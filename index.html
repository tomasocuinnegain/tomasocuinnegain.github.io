Michael left us the way he always was with us&#133;serving others   with his heart and mind on the love of God. </font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Many have   come to know and love Michael from many different places. He was a resident   of Harlem, NY and Huntington, West Virginia. He taught regularly on the streets   of Union Square and Fulton Market. Mike&#146;s life was a Sundance and we find   it quite fitting that he literally passed in the shadow of the sacred arbor   (the Tree of Life), at the Sundance Ceremony in Pinon, Arizona. It was the third   year of the ceremony (of four)&#133;and Michael has left us all to complete   his Sundance (his work bearing the light of God in these darkest of times).</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> He was with   approximately 30 friends and relatives &#150; grandkids, daughters, and dear   friends - that he led in a &#147;journey to remember&#148; across America in   a ten-day caravan visiting the sacred sites of this country until reaching the   Sundance ceremony, the four-day sacrificial dance to the Tree of Life, hosted   by the Navajo (and Sioux) nation in northern Arizona. Mike collapsed of heart   failure and passed over in the midst of the prayers of his family and those   gathered - warriors, dancers, Chiefs, medicine and holy men and women and supporters   - at the Sundance. His last words were &#147;Nan, Nan&#148;.... Nan, as many   know, was Michael&#146;s wife of 47 years who left this earth on September 11,   1990. Michael longed to be reunited with his eternal love and we are celebrating   his liberation to new life and reunion with his Beloved. We are saddened and   grievous by the loss of this giant among us... this light. Michael was a great   teacher of love and committment. He shared that the depth of the Mystery of   Christ was, in essence, the &quot;being a living sacrifice&quot;. As the warriors   were preparing to make the piercing on the fourth day of the Sundance (the piercing   is a metaphoric display of the sacrifice we are making in order to bring about   the new age of humanity)...Mike essentially made the living sacrifice. The following   is a poem we found in his bag at the Sundance. By no means are we proposing   that Mike consciously put himself at risk, we just see how fitting it all turned   out to be. This was a poem we know he was wriring to Nan.</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="2">Another like it now is tied,around the sacred tree.<br>  A marriage vow renewed and sealed between earth and me<br>  and heaven thee.<br>  This decent I'm sure is over now. The service was a quiet one .<br>  I hope &quot;I know&quot; you saw me there. I've been there....<br>  I hope &quot;I know &quot; you saw me there.<br>  Tis , Gravity the force of love ...me&nbsp; below and you above .<br>  The wedding was a quiet one&nbsp; I hope &quot;I know&quot; you saw me there.<br>  The Sun Dance is not quite complete. The decent however (my work), I'm sure   it is .<br>  There's still the piercing round (the living sacrifice). The ladder is found.</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#147;Greater   love hath no soul than this, that one lay down their life for their friends...&#148;(John   15:13)</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Michael   chose to teach and be with people on the streets. Often people would ask where   they could come to study, or what church they could attend. Michael always said   the street was the classroom and our very hearts were the church. You could   often find him at Union Square during the months of March to November, especially   during the High Holy Days in September.</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Mike&#146;s   message was simple&#133;&quot;Come out of her my people and be not partakers   of her sins&quot;. He cried in the wilderness for Americans (and people everywhere)   to awaken to the work that God is working in our day. He came to teach that   there is a light being born in the midst of the darkness of this age. He cried   for peace, he taught peace, he lived peace. He never laid any of his burdens   on others but always kept them quietly to himself. He listened to all peoples,   learned from all faiths, loved all races and brought forth an understanding   of all the world&#146;s sacred traditions as interconnected. Thus, all of humanity   shares in the family of being human.</font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For those   of you who have been studying with Michael over the years, his work will be   continuing within the growing circle of close friends and family who are called   to bring the Spirit of the Remnant into the world. </font></P><P ALIGN="left"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Please stay   in contact with us.

Actually the foundation of this work was set years</font><FONT SIZE=4>   <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">before</font>, <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">after   reading an article in one of Jacksonville, Florida's Sunday papers about an   old gentleman named Elvy E. Callaway from Bristol, Florida, who wrote a book   entitled <I>In the Beginning. </I>In it he advanced the idea that that region   in southwest Georgia </font><font size=4><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(from   where "Jimmy" Carter comes),</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">was   the original site of the lower garden of Eden described in the 2nd chapter of   Genesis. (Please see chapter 2 and the subchapter in the Addendum entitled The   Lower Garden, as well as </font><font size=4><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">   Ezekiel 20:45-49</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">).   In the emerging interest of trying to fit such an idea with the events of our   times, and in the subsequent discovery of the doctrines and precepts of that   discipline of study known as Kabbalah, there seemed to be a Great Circle of   some sorts connecting itself, one that did indeed begin in Genesis (2:8-17),   and which does indeed complete itself here in our time in the words that say:   <I>And those who overcome will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in   the midst of the Paradise of God. </I>(Revelation 2:7). The whole of these ideas   could also be understood in the words: <I>Know ye not...that it is He who sits   upon the Circle of the Earth. </I>(Isaiah 40:21-24, KJV).</font></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">This work at times will   wax tedious, with commentary and with reference after reference to historical   and biblical texts. Such labor, however (the intentional concentration required   to remain on the subject), is a necessary exercize for the soul. It provides   for the reader the same measure of focused contemplation, detailed study, and   concern for the things of God as was demanded by the work itself. (There are,   however, shortcuts to the ideas that are expressed in the main chapters of this   work in those subchapters and letters listed in the Table of Contents under   the heading of Since September 11th).</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">It has also been our hope   all of these years to speak to the political community, to the intellectuals,   to the socialists and activists in the antiwar, antiglobalism and environmental   movements, who have by and large grown weary and suspicious of religious ideas,   and who have struck out on their own to change the world. There are things unfolding   in the earth today--Divine Realities--that must be understood. History is coming   to its conclusions. (We realize, of course, that religion, in its adverse and   darkest aspects, is also the cause of all these disorders in the world, and   deserves in some great measure to be mistrusted). On October 6th, in New York   City, a demonstration was held in Central Park against the impending American   war in the Middle East. A Pledge of Resistance was distributed to the thousands   attending, which concluded with the words: &quot;Another world is possible and   we pledge to make it real.&quot; We join in the pledge, and have been laboring   at it since this work began. The reality is, however, that it can not happen   unless God is (really) allowed back into the equation. It is God, the Creators   of Heaven and Earth Themselves, who are risen up everywhere around us, and in   us, in the sum of every natural and human event, and who are bringing this age   to its just (and may we add, terrible), conclusion. There is no other reality.   It is God (Creation itself if you will), who has brought us to this great crisis   in human history in order to bring the new world that we seek into existence.   There are conditions though, that cannot be disregarded or forsaken, and that   must ultimately be accepted. There is a structure to Creation, the plan has   been unfolding since the beginning of recorded history, no, since the beginning   of time itself--out of Darkness, Light; out of chaos, order; out of anarchy,   true community and out of simple indifference, true love--and any attempt to   supplant it, whether from the Right or the Left, will only result in increased   frustration and disappointment, further division, more confusion and continued   disorder. We must adopt a spiritual world view, one that is at last capable,   in the midst of these unfolding social, political and economic crises, of uniting   all of us heart and mind to one another. (But it is we who must conform to the   Design, not the other way around). Those who are presently attempting to create   the world in their own violent and oppressive image--the capitalists and militarists   of the Western world, along with the religious institutions that support them--have   stolen the plans (along with everything else). How is it written: <i>If we had   known what day the Thief would come.</i> Those who seek true righteousness and   true justice in the earth, and the possibility of another world, must have the   plans back in their own hands. They contain the next set of instructions. This   work is such an effort. (Please consider the words at 1 Thessalonians, chapter   5. KJV).</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">This is not pop-kabbalah.   And although this work will express itself in terms of the Laurianic system   of Kabbalah, it will not confine itself to the Judaic expression of this system   alone. There are two sides to the Tree of Life, a Jewish side and a Christian   side--Judah and Levi. (Of course the Tree has a Taoist dimension, a Vedic and   Buddhist dimension, it encompasses Islam and gathers the whole of Africa in   its branches, and carries all of us together to where the trunk of this Living   Oracle is rooted deep in the soil of Indigenous American spiritual consciousness.   It is a very ancient Tree). It will not, however, conform to the theological   doctrines of the great world-church--the church of Caesar--which has beset the   world with so much confusion and with so many evils since the time of Christ.   And neither will it confirm any of the simplistic, or otherwise literal methods   of scriptural exegesis in use by mainline Christian fundamentalists or American   evangelicals (or any of the other practitioners of Ba'al in our time). This   method of interpretation cannot be purchased in religious bookstores. It is   not American fast food. And neither is it an attempt to prosyltize Jews. There   is only one True Religion in the world, the one that God is creating. Everyone   is approaching the Tree of Life from their own historic perspective. (Nevertheless,   the two Anointed Ones in our time shall appear on the Jewish [not-Zionist] side   of the Oracle at the place named Majesty, as it is written: <i>The Lord appointed   <a href="WebPages/SideLinks/TheSunandMoon.htm">the Moon for seasons</a>: the   Sun knoweth his (own) going down...</i>Psalm 104:19; Zechariah, chapter 4).   </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">...This work will require,   </font><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">however, </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">as   it blends with this previously unimaginable means of communication (the Internet...while   we still have access to it), the same spiritual discipline and methods as were   employed by those Essenes and Buddhists, Gnostics and Kabbalists of old, male   and female alike, who have passed on to us in our time, not only an historical   tradition to emulate but vast volumes of sacred texts to interpret. And by approaching   these texts with the same spiritual discipline as they were composed, we may   extract from them the same meanings as were put into them, and in the very same   Light: <i>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which   are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all   the words of the law. </i></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">(Deuteronomy   29:29)</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">.
