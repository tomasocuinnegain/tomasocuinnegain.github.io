  with all of the ideas, interpretations, and revelations that went into hiding 
  with the Mother herself, when She, along with the mysteries of the Feminine 
  Principle, went into occultation at the time of Christ two thousand years ago. 
  Where is this Child being born? Naturally, in the lower parts of the earth (below

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Once upon a time twins <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(an 
    allusion to the two sides of the Tree of Life)</font> were conceived in the 
    same womb. Seconds, minutes, hours <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(centuries)</font>, 
    passed as the two dormant lives developed. The spark of life glowed until 
    it ignited in the formation of their tiny embryonic minds. With their simple 
    minds came feeling, and with feeling perception, of their surroundings, of 
    the other, of self.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When each perceived the life of 
    the other, as well as their own, they also sensed that life was good, and 
    they laughed and rejoiced, the one saying, How lucky we are to have been conceived, 
    and to have this world. The other chiming, And blessed be the mother who gave 
    us this life and each other. Each budded and grew arms and fingers, lean legs 
    and stubby toes. They stretched their lungs, churned and turned in their new-found 
    world. They explored their world, and in it found the life-cord which gave 
    them life from the precious mother's blood. They said, How great is the mother 
    that she shares all she has with us. And they were pleased and satisfied with 
    their world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As time passed they noticed a change 
    in each other. We are changing, said the one. What can it mean? IT MEANS, 
    said the other, THAT WE ARE DRAWING NEAR TO THE BIRTH.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An unsettling chill crept over 
    the two, and they both feared, for they sensed that birth meant leaving their 
    world behind. Were it up to me, said the one, I would live here forever.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we must be born, said the other. 
    It has happened to all others who were here before us. For, indeed, there 
    was evidence of life there before, as the mother had born others.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But is there life after birth? 
    How can there be life after birth, said the other. Do we not shed our life-cord? 
    And have you ever talked to anyone who has been born? Has anyone ever reentered 
    the womb after birth? No! And he fell into despair and lamented, If the purpose 
    of conception and all our growth is that it be ended in birth, then life is 
    truly absurd.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He stabbed the darkness with his 
    unseeing eyes, and as he clutched his precious life-cord to his chest, said, 
    If this is so, and life is absurd, then there really can be no mother. But 
    there is a mother cried the other. Who else gave us this nourishment and our 
    world? We get our own nourishment, and the world has always been here. And 
    if there is a mother, where is she? Have you seen her? Does she ever talk 
    to you? No, we invented the mother because it satisfied a need in us. It made 
    us feel happy and secure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus while one despaired the other 
    resigned itself to the birth. Hours ached into days, and days fell into weeks. 
    And it came time. Both knew that the birth was at hand. And both feared what 
    they did not know. As the one was the first to be conceived, so it was the 
    first to be born. The other followed soon after.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They cried as they were born into 
    the light, and coughed out fluids, gasping for dry air. And when they were 
    sure they had been born, they opened their eyes, seeing for the first time, 
    and found themselves cradled in the warm arms of the Mother. They lay open-mouthed 
    and awe-struck before that Beauty and Truth they could not otherwise have 
    hoped to have known.&quot; <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Who is this Mother? First 
  of all She is not simply the result of metaphysical and theological word-play, 
  but rather the natural extension of Divine Reality which constantly expresses 
  itself in every study of the laws and principles of the Universe. Before creation 
  (the Great Emanation) God was united with Him and Herself (or Her and Himself) 
  in one singularly-conscious form, until the moment of Creation itself when God 
  broke, or emanated, into positive and negative forces and the material order 
  appeared. With it appeared all the conceptual forms into which the Mind of Creation 
  descended, and with which it would clothe itself. With creation She came forth:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="+1">SHE IS A TREE 
    OF LIFE to them that lay hold upon Her: and happy is everyone that retaineth 
    Her...</font></i><font size="+1">(Proverbs 3:18)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> She is ever-present. 
  She is the Feminine manifestation of the Presence of God. She (along with the 
  Father), is both hidden and revealed everywhere in Nature, in myth, and in the 
  pages of Holy Writ. As God is Creator, She is Creation. She descended with the 
  process of Creation, from form to form--always keeping the concept of the Divine 
  Father (the Higher invisible Principle) with Her--through the formation of the 
  Solar System, to that of the planet Earth, to the creation of humanity on Earth, 
  and finally to the ongoing creation of the mind of humanity in our very own 
  day. She has given birth a billion times, and (just as She gave birth 2,000 
  years ago to the age that is now ending) She is travailing in birth again, and 
  the whole world is experiencing Her fierce contractions...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the scriptures She 
  is our mother Sarah bringing forth Her child <i>in the time of life.</i> (Genesis 
  18, and 19). She hid the leaven in Three measures of meal until the whole was

<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The kingdom of heaven 
    is like unto a woman who taketh of the incorruptable leaven and hideth it 
    in three measures of meal...And till the whole is leavened, being baked by 
    fire...becoming one loaf...</i>(The Gospel of the Perfect Life XXXIX.5).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further evidence of a common source 
    is found in the doctrine common to Indian, Greek, and Babylonian systems that 
    all originates from a watery abyss (the womb of the world), and again from

    the Word, in the double meaning of Saras, which can be taken as water and 
    voice, hence Sarasvati...Her characteristics are found in the Babylonian goddess 
    Sarpantium, who, as blended with Erua, the daughter of Ea, becomes 'the Lady 
    of the Deep,' the 'Voice of the Deep,' and possessor of knowledge concealed

    is both masculine and feminine. They have translated the feminine-plural by 
    a masculine-singular in the case of the word ELOHIM. They have, however, left 
    an inadvertent admission of their knowledge that it was plural in Genesis 
    1:26 and 5:1,2: 'And ELOHIM said: Let US make man.' Again (v.27), how could 
    Adam be made in the image of Elohim, male and female, unless the Elohim were

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The word Elohim is a plural ending 
    from a feminine-singular ALH (Eloh), by adding IM to the word. But inasmuch

  The world is reeling under the effects of male domination. It is filled with

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then why is the Child 
  of Revelation called a &quot;manchild,&quot; or a &quot;Son?&quot; Please! students 
  of scripture, feminists, everyone, quit the childishness. God has only so many 
  physical and literary forms to work with, and there are only so many principles 
  to be expressed, so stop stumbling over them. Stop being offended by them. Come 
  to maturity (Ephesians 4:13). Be spiritual. God hid these principles from the 
  literal, unspiritual mind, so that the spiritual mind could be manifest in the 
  last day, so that Divine Wisdom could be revealed in the last day. This child 
  is called a &quot;son&quot; because a son (not in the literal, or physical sense, 
  but in the world of thought-forms and ideas) has a penus. And a penus (not in 
  the literal or physical sense but in the world of thought-forms and ideas) is 
  capable of penetrating and impregnating another. Thus the penus, and by extension 
  the notion of a &quot;son,&quot; is a metaphor for the ability to penetrate 
  another--not with a penus but with the seed of truth, with the meaning of the 
  Word of God, with a right interpretation of reality. Is the female capable? 
  Is she equal to the task? Of course! She has always known it. Has she been called 
  to it? From the very beginning. Is her name not Adam (Genesis 5:1,2), thus, 
  is she not also the Christ? So let us grow past the allegories and metaphors, 
  the types and images. Let's cast off the yoke of literalism and get on with 
  the higher realities of Life. (Please read the chapter entitled &quot;Circumcision&quot;). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the following Gnostic 
  scene Peter, along with Andrew, plays the heavy as usual. He is typed as the 
  rigid literalist who must be taught the secret meaning of the Scriptures and 
  the lessons of the Spirit over and over again:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But they were grieved. They 
    wept greatly, saying, How shall we go to the Gentiles and preach the gospel 
    of the Son of man? If they did not spare him, how will they spare us? Then 
    Mary (Magdalene) stood up, greeted her brethren, and said: Do not be irresolute, 
    for his grace will be entirely with you, and will protect you. But rather 
    let us praise his greatness, for he has prepared us AND MADE US INTO MEN. 
    When Mary said this, she turned their hearts to the good, and they began to 
    discuss the words of the Savior.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peter said to Mary, Sister, we 
    know that the Savior loved you more than the rest of women. Tell us the words 
    of the Savior which you remember--which you know and we do not, nor have we 
    heard them. Mary answered and said, What is hidden from you I will proclaim 
    to you. And she began to speak to them...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(When Mary was finished) she fell 
    silent, since it was to this point that the Savior had spoken with her. But 
    Andrew answered and said to the brethren, Say what you wish to say about what 
    she has said. I at least do not believe that the Savior said these things. 
    For certainly these teachings are strange ideas. Peter answered and spoke 
    concerning the same things. He questioned them about the Savior: Did he really 
    speak with a woman without our knowledge and not openly? Are we to turn about 
    and listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then Mary wept (for them) and said 
    to Peter, My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think that I thought 
    this up by myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior? Levi answered 
    and said to Peter. Peter you have always been hot tempered. Now I see you 
    contending against the women like the adversaries. But if the Savior made 
    her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her 
    very well. That is why he loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed 
    AND PUT ON THE PERFECT MAN and acquire him for ourselves as he commanded us, 
    and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or other law beyond 
    which the Savior said. (Rome?). (Saudi Arabia?).&quot; <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The

  not. Who would follow them if they did? These guys were not jerks. They were 
  the radicals, the spiritual counter culture of their time. They are members 
  of the <i>Fellowship of the Mystery</i>. And the females among them are all 
  part of the same spiritual conspiracy. One cannot imagine, for instance, that 
  Peter's wife (or any other of the Essene ladies) is some dotish, unintelligent 
  figure cowering around the backdrop of the New Testament narratives, on her 
  way to spiritual oblivion, whose only purpose is to wait on Peter, or that she 
  would stand for such talk unless she herself understood the imagery. But rather 
  imagine her strong and spiritually vibrant, and as perceptive in all of these 
  matters as he. And be sure, if Peter is a prophet it is because she has given 
  him the power to be one. And if he has come to understand the meaning of the 
  higher mysteries for himself, experientially, which include the mysteries of 
  the Feminine principle, it is because she has helped him learn them. And if 
  the penus is a metaphor the vagina even more so:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Vagina...A Cave of Treasures 
    concealed in a garden of delight. It is the pathway to the Navel of the Earth; 
    it is the portal of life itself. The uninitiated, the unchosen, the unspiritual,

    lusted after it, even forced themselves upon it. They may have imagined themselves 
    its guardians, set rules for it, and commanded it to stay in its place, but 
    they have never experienced it. It is the Higher Mysteries, and the way to 
    the hidden, inner meanings of Life itself that we speak of. It is Divine Wisdom 
    that we speak of, sometimes Mother, sometimes Sister, sometimes Lover, that 
    we speak of. She is true love, and she is heavy with spiritual birth...</font></p>

  It is all metaphor. Not only must we make ourselves female (nazarites in the 
  fullest sense) to the higher order of reality, in order to perceive (or conceive) 
  that reality within ourselves, but we must learn to cherish that reality, as 
  well as its mirror image here below. Thus each of us must learn that love (and 
  therefore sexuality), is a sacrament of the very highest order. We must be taught 
  the Tantric path (in ways that the lower order of things by itself is incapable 
  of expressing), and learn not to partake of sexuality frivolously, without realizing, 
  or coming to realize, that we are partaking of the very highest mysteries of

  pleasure...</font> </p>

  cosmic devotion the Divine Mother and Father have for each other in the worlds 
  above. In the symbol of the Universal Tao the Two are found in an eternal state 
  of intellectual, emotional, and sexual embrace. Life on Earth is the fruit of 
  this relationship. Thus those who understand these things--that they are children, 
  born of both Heaven and Earth--strive to bring themselves into conformity with 
  the pattern of this relationship, to a whole and balanced state of mind; and 
  certainly so if we wish to pass through the dimensions of this world into the 
  pure dimensions of the world-beyond. To pass through the Door our individual 
  minds must be aligned with the Mind of the Universe itself, with the Central 
  Pillar of the Oracle of Nature where both that the Male and Female Principles 
  of Life meet and face each other in the mysteries of Christ. Both purity of 
  mind, and the liberation of the mind, are the keys, for it is the mind alone 
  that can pass over--and only the mind of Light at that.</font></p>

  who consider themselves to be religious to <i>complete the Hajj</i>. When they 
  do they will learn to stop enforcing their own interpretation of &quot;purity&quot; 
  upon others, but to see to it that they become pure themselves. Only then--only 
  through unconditional love, and only through a mature understanding of the often 
  rigorous process of personal transformation that one must experience, how the 
  pathway to spiritual perfection often carries the individual soul off in other 
  directions before it returns them to the straight path again--may one person 
  become a guide to another. Everyone <i>must</i> work out their own salvation, 
  <i>with trembling within</i>, but free from the condemnation and the restrictions 
  of others. The path of return is marked <i>Freewill Offering</i>. (Leviticus

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To bear the yoke of one's 
  own lower thoughts and impulses are the heaviest oppressions of all. All social, 
  political, and sexual oppression arises from those places in the soul (the heart

  to the higher Light. If the Divine Mother is revealing Herself in our day, in 
  ways that are perfectly conducive to the attainment of true holiness and purity 
  of mind (as in <i>Miriam No Longer Behind the Veil</i>), and if the Anointed 
  Ones shall be revealed in Her light, Her daughters and sons may do so as well: 
  Her daughters may take off the veils. They may come out into the Light--but

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is also time to break 
  down the <i>mehitzah</i> (as many already have). The principles of reality are 
  based upon the idea of &quot;symmetry&quot; (Yin-Yang), (Positive-Negative), 
  (Male-Female). Those precepts are being discovered and reconstructed in the 
  findings of 20th century physics, just as they were anciently constructed into 
  the dimensions of <a href="../UsedImages/pg000amandalacontact.gif">the Oracle</a> 
  with its male side and its female side. The precepts of the Torah, which are 
  based upon these very same principles of reality, have always contained and 
  implied the principles of balance that operate and function between them, and 
  which join them together as one. And initiates in the hidden science have always 
  been free to interpret them in that light, and to guide their own lives in accordance 
  with them. Which is why the truly spiritual seem at times to be irreligious 
  in the eyes of the orthodox, because they always seem to be in violation of 
  some (literal) precept of the law, or of some custom or another as they are 
  observed by the rigidly orthodox. As far as Judaism is concerned, and the struggles 
  that exist between Reformed and Conservative Jews, and their Orthodox co-religionists, 
  there is a blessing and a curse on each of their houses. If either knew, for 
  instance, where the <i>Western</i> wall of the temple was really located, if 
  either possessed true <i>Daat</i>, then the one would not be insisting on the 
  right to pray at it (at that wall over there), whether in mixed company or not, 
  and the other would not be found storming its precincts in fitful attempts to 
  drive females from it, or to divide the females from the males, as they do. 
  Such behavior may indicate a zeal for the law, but also an historic ignorance 
  of its meanings. <a href="../UsedImages/Wall.gif">The spectacle</a> is tiring 
  to God (if such a thing were possible). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The scriptures are full 
  of male terminology because they are full of the power of penetration and impregnation. 
  The mind that is opened by them, and to them, becomes one with them. It has 
  nothing, however, to do with the physical differences that exist between the 
  male and the female, but rather with the literary differences that exist between 
  the terms <i>man</i> and <i>woman</i>. Religious orthodoxy stumbles over these 
  terms, and cannot, in its own rigid adherence to literal forms, assimilate the 
  meanings or the effects. It is fixed in a literal interpretation of the word 
  <i>man</i>. But so is Feminism. It is captured by the mystique associated with 
  the word <i>woman</i>. </font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Try 
  as it does to unburden itself of all the connotations associated with the word, 
  it will not let go of the word itself. (Not that it should. It is a very powerful 
  word. <i>Women</i> should just come to terms with the meaning and the implications 
  of the word itself). We have expressed it in other places and it must be expressed 
  here again. The term &quot;man&quot; in the scriptures refers (in their not-so-hidden, 
  and not so mysteriously complicated sense), to every soul--male and female alike--who 
  have attained to the higher realities. It is as Paul begins to intimate when 
  he says: <i>For we know that the Torah is spiritual, and, that we </i>(have 
  also been)<i> delivered from its literal restrictions on the mind, having died 
  to them through</i> (an understanding of)<i> the mysteries of the Tree of Life...That 
  we should serve in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the 
  letter</i>. (Romans 7:4-14). But even the <i>oldness of the letter</i> has always 
  made the male and female equal. The <i>newness of the Spirit</i>, in this case, 
  simply illuminates the meanings that have been there from the beginning:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
  much for the Vatican's point of view. Uta Ranke-Heinemann treats the subject 
  splendidly in her <i>Eunuchs For the Kingdom of Heaven, Women, Sexuality, and 
  the Catholic Church</i>. (Of course this was the intended effect of the Spirit's 
  literary devices to begin with. She deprived the Roman hierarchy, obsessed as 
  it was, and is, with its own literal, male sense of things, from understanding 
  Peter's <i>Hidden Man of the Heart.</i> 1 Peter 3:4. The entire mystery was 
  sealed from the Roman church). And the rabbis--those who had access to such 
  works as the <i>Bahir</i> (one of the earliest books of the Kabbalah to emerge 
  out of the even earlier traditions of the Merkabah mystics), and who subsequently 
  made a deep study of such works--should also have come to the meanings but did 
  not. They read the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In Hebrew, Solomon is Shlomoh, 
    from the root Shalom, meaning 'peace.' (See 1 Chronicles 22:9). As discussed 
    earlier, peace is the attribute of Daat, Knowledge, which is the concept of 
    union and reconciliation, especially between male and female. THE WORD SHALOM--PEACE--COMES 
    FROM THE SAME ROOT AS SHALEM, WHICH MEANS PERFECT AND COM PLETE. IN PARTICULAR, 
    NEITHER THE MALE OR THE FEMALE IS COMPLETE WITHOUT THE OTHER.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shalom (ShaLWM) is spelled WITH 
    A VAW (or Waw), <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(The place where 
    the Male and Female Principles meet on the Tree of Life)</font>, while Shlomoh 
    is spelled with a Heh. As discussed earlier, the Vaw represents the male, 
    while the Heh is female. (As in Yod Heh Vaw Heh...Yod-Father, Heh-Mother, 
    VAW-SON). Shlomoh-Solomon is therefore the concept of 'Peace' in Malkhut-Kingship, 
    the Female. Shlomoh-Solomon is therefore said to be 'the king to whom peace 
    belongs.' (Shavout 35b, Rashi on Song of Songs 1:1). God therefore told Solomon 
    that his name was like the name of 'My Glory' since glory always refers to 
    the sefirah of Malkhut-Kingship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisdom was then given to Solomon 
    through 'the Daughter,' which is also the sefirah of Malkhut-Kingship. It 
    is an important kabbalistic teaching that Malkhut-Kingship is the sefirah 
    through which all others are revealed. Since Solomon made himself a counterpart 
    of Malkhut-Kingship, he could draw through it.&quot; <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bahir 
    II.65</font>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...and then continue, 
  despite the words, and in the very presence of their own female counterparts--their 
  wives and daughters--to thank the Master of the Universe for not making them 
  <i>ignoramuses</i> or <i>woman</i>. Even if all concerned suspect the allegorical 
  or esoteric meaning in the phrase, it is time to dispense with it. Those who 
  translated this work approached right-meaning at <i>Bahir 198</i> when discussing 
  <i>Genesis 1:28</i>, and then utterly confused it again when quoting Genesis 
  2:18, and 22, by reassociating the word <i>female</i> with the word <i>woman</i> 
  again--substituting the former for the latter as did the entire orthodox world 
  at that time. The Gnostics (those who &quot;really knew&quot; that is) made 
  no such mistake, and searched for language capable of conveying the true and 
  higher realities:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And Thought performed a deed 
    and she came forth, namely she who had appeared before him in the shine of 
    his light. This is the First Power which was before all of them which came 
    forth from his mind. She is the forethought of the All--HER LIGHT SHINES LIKE 
    HIS LIGHT--the perfect power which is the image of the invisible, virginal 
    Spirit who is perfect. The first power, the glory of Barbelo, the perfect 
    glory in the aeons (the sefiroth), the glory of the revelation, she glorified 
    the virginal spirit and it was she who praised him because thanks to him she 
    came forth. This is the First-Thought, his image; SHE BECAME THE WOMB OF EVERYTHING. 
    FOR IT IS SHE WHO IS PRIOR TO THEM ALL, THE MOTHER-FATHER, THE FIRST MAN, 
    the Holy Spirit, the Thrice-male, the Thrice-powerful, the Thrice-named androgynous 
    one, and the eternal aeon among the invisible ones, and the first to come 
    forth.&quot; <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Apocryphon of

  alike, were all driven out over time by the emerging and more powerful dictates 
  of the World-church. They were driven almost out of the pages of history itself--in

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIMOY...You asked me a very interesting 
    question. My Shekinah...is an artistic vision, my artistic interpretation. 
    I'm not claiming to actually see or be in the physical presence of Shekinah. 
    I have a spiritual sense of what a Shekinah is all about for me. And I have 
    experienced that at times, at various times in my life.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIMOY...I think--I hope-- that 
    most people at one time or another in their lives have a feeling of being 
    in a state of grace for a moment or two, feeling that all has come together 
    for them, that they have a sense of harmony, a sense of inner peace, a sense 
    of successful combining of instinct and will. It's the coincidence of events

    a lot of Jews are not familiar with the idea, the concept. It was the Kabbalists 
    in the 1600s who taught in what is now Safed in Israel who very energetic 
    about their belief in mysticism and Shekinah. Not a lot of people read or 
    study Kabbalah. It's a narrow field...It's a very interesting issue to me 
    because it grew out of an Orthodox experience, and yet it is a feminist idea 
    that is not particularly welcome to Orthodox people. I find it, right or wrong, 
    a very interesting and strange mixture of spirituality, religion and contemporary

    to pray. MY SENSE IS THAT SHEKINAH CAN WEAR TEFILLIN IF SHE WANTS...I wonder 
    if you're at all aware that in Israel there's a law that says that a woman 
    standing at the Western Wall to pray in Jerusalem and wearing tefillin is 
    subject to criminal prosecution and can be jailed UP TO SEVEN YEARS.</font></p>

  Paul says it plainly enough when alluding to Adam and Eve at Ephesians 5:31,32: 
  <i>This is a great mystery</i>, he says,<i> but I speak concerning Christ </i>(the 
  male and female joined together)<i> and the Church. </i>She (Eve), is not the 
  figure of the female gender, but rather, she is a figure of all the males and 
  females together, the priests, rabbis, ministers, reverends, and imams (and 
  all others who cling to their lesser interpretations), who have not yet ascended 
  to the higher realities, and who therefore keep their flocks entangled in the 
  gross elements of the world and in the literal elements of the Word. &quot;She&quot; 
  (Eve) is all those to whom the first Adam (the first spiritual couple) went 
  in ancient times, in their first attempts to explain the meaning of the revelations 
  and insights they were receiving from God (from the Mind of Nature Herself). 
  &quot;She&quot; (Eve) was Adam's first church. Has &quot;she&quot; not given 
  birth to two kinds of sons, Cain and Abel? Are they not still with us? Are not 
  the sons of Darkness now grown powerful, violent, and wicked in the earth? All 
  in their father's name? Are they not now occupying thrones and seats of power, 
  and positions of great worldly authority in the earth, seats which their own 
  professed Father (Christ, the second Adam), refused to sit in? (See Matthew 
  4:8-11; John 6:15). These are the disobedient ones, of whom the scriptures refer 
  when they say: <i>Their feet shall slide in due time.</i> (Deuteronomy 32:35), 
  and finally: <i>They shall kill you thinking they are doing God service.</i> 
  (John 16:2). It is the point the original author of the <i>Kerygma Patrou</i>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...he knows that the spiritual 
  mind coming to perfection will not mistake the hidden principles and allegories 
  in these texts for literal commandments. He knows the Divine Spirit will reveal 
  Her own meanings in the fulness of time, as She did in great part to the 9th 
  century kabbalist, John Scotus Eriugena:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;St. John the Evangelist, 
    too, heard the voice of the Word. Responding to its call, he appropriated 
    and entered into it. Fully listened, and divested of all that was not the 
    Word, he became one with the divine spiritual field of its nature. Thus in 
    a state of pure reciprocity which contains the meaning-being of all things, 
    St. John became the ear of the Word. Becoming its ear, he spoke, and speaking 
    he became its mouth and voice, the Voice of the Eagle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this way and without warning 
    we are plunged into the central mystery of Christianity: the meeting place 
    of the human soul with Christ in the phenomenal world. How does this take 
    place? Consider Eriugena's interpretation of the story of Christ and the woman 
    of Samaria at Jacob's well:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is the 'sixth hour,' the cosmic 
    midday; Christ, tired by the rigors of incarnation, meets THE WOMAN--THE HUMAN 
    SOUL--by the well of the world. Seated upon its rim, he asks water of her, 
    a Samaritan. Surprised, she wonders why he, a Jew, would ask water of her. 
    He replies that if she knew whom he really was, she would ask him in turn 
    for 'living water.' The woman then notices that Jesus has no way of drawing 
    any kind of water. But he repeats that the water he offers is living, a well 
    continuously springing up unto eternal life. Finally the woman asks him for 
    some, and he replies, 'Go, call thy husband.' That is, he says to her that 
    she cannot drink his water unless she first calls her husband. Eriugena explains 
    this as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'THE WOMAN IS THE RATIONAL SOUL 
    (anima) WHOSE HUSBAND (literally, 'vir'. or 'man'--with the connotation of 
    active power, not 'maritus' or 'conjunx') IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE ANIMUS, 
    which is variously named now intellect (intellectctus), now mind (mens), now 
    animus and often even spiritus. This is the husband of whom the Apostle says 
    'The head of the woman is the man, the head of the man is Christ, the head 
    of Christ is God.' IN OTHER WORDS, THE HEAD OF THE ANIMA IS THE INTELLECTUS, 
    AND THE HEAD OF THE INTELLECTUS IS CHRIST. Such is the natural order of the 
    human creature. THE SOUL MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE RULE OF THE MIND, THE MIND 
    TO CHRIST <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(the idea of harmony 
    and balance between the Two principles)</font>, and thereby the whole being 
    is submitted through Christ to God...Spirit revolves perpetually about God 
    and is well named the husband and the guide of the other parts of the soul.'&quot; 
    <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Voice of the Eagle, The Heart 
    of Celtic Christianity, by Christopher Bamford</font>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus in the spiritual 
  realm not only may both the male and the female be considered &quot;man,&quot; 
  but either one of them can be the &quot;husband&quot; of the other one as well. 
  Only intractable and spiritually hardened minds refuse to break down the barriers 
  that exist between themselves and their own imperfect, and unspiritual interpretations. 
  But these shall, sadly, be left behind as the human mind goes on to perfection 
  in Christ. Both males and females possess the same faculties of animus and anima. 
  When they are in harmony, the one above the other, the &quot;husband&quot; is 
  the head of the &quot;wife.&quot; But when the female finds herself married 
  to a male who does not understand these principles, when she does, then she 
  is the spiritual husband in the relationship and is required to honor her mate 
  as the &quot;spiritually weaker vessel.&quot; (1 Peter 3:1-7). Everything must 
  be accomplished in love (when it is possible). But when both understand these 
  principles there is true harmony, and both are equally submissive to the other. 
  The middle wall of partition is removed (as it will between all Christians and 
  Jews on the Tree of Life), and there is peace.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The entire language of 
  the Scriptures is based upon this synthesis of principle and form. And that 
  the Universe itself is based upon cosmic sexual principles is evident, not only 
  in the sublime union that binds the male and female together in the highest 
  (tantric) state of love--creating life, bringing forth life--but in the corresponding 
  union that binds the upper and lower worlds to each other. What words do we 
  use to express the relationship? Father (pure Thought) above, and Mother (the 
  phenomenal World, out of which every one of us has been born), below. Some in 
  the Feminist camp contend that the Father and Son overthrew the Mother with 
  the advent of Christianity. It is an impossible reality. God is not divided, 
  and cannot be overthrown. Just as Wisdom (Hokhmah) is the first extension of 
  Kether, so Wisdom (Sophia) is the natural extension of the invisible Presence 
  of God in the world. As She descended she took upon Herself all the physical 
  forms of the Lower order, giving birth in time to the literary forms...but also 
  to the very notion of God the Father itself. If She had not instructed us in 
  the ways of His Presence, we would have known absolutely nothing of Him at all. 
  Between them they brought forth the &quot;Son.&quot;</font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They 
  entrusted all of their mysteries to the realm of the Son, but They, and especially 
  She, did not leave them unattended:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There can be no doubt that 
    the goddess to whom the Hebrews clung with such tenacity down to the days 
    of Josiah, and to whom they returned with such remorse following the destruction 
    of the Jerusalem temple, was, whatever the prophets had to say about her, 
    no foreign seductress, BUT A HEBREW GODDESS, THE BEST DIVINE MOTHER THE PEOPLE 
    HAD HAD AT THAT TIME.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the death of the spirit 
    of idolatry in the days of Nehemiah, the Hebrew goddess succeeded in surviving. 
    She underwent, to be sure, an astounding metamorphosis, but then that too 
    is the mark of a living Deity. In one of her manifestations she penetrated--in 
    what period we can only conjecture--the rebuilt sanctuary as THE FEMALE CHERUB, 
    POISED IN MARITAL EMBRACE WITH HER MALE PARTNER IN THE DARK CELL OF THE HOLY 
    OF HOLIES. In another she became the manifestation of God's Presence, THE 
    SHEKINAH--a feminine name just as God's is masculine--a loving, rejoicing, 
    motherly, suffering, mourning, and in general emotion-charged aspect of deity...</font></p>

    the destruction of the Jerusalem temple and the subsequent exile of Israel, 
    which came to be regarded as a catastrophic event not only for the people 
    but also for God. The Shekinah, or Matronit, as She now was called, in her 
    motherly love for her children, went into exile with them. This brought about

  figure of <i>the</i> <i>Church</i> (a title which the Roman and Orthodox churches 
  arrogated to themselves over time), but She has been dwelling in the literary 
  figure of Eve from the very beginning in the story in Genesis. But more: in 
  her darkest aspect, and from the very beginning, She had ensouled Herself in 
  the character of Lilith as well. (Read the entire text of <i>The Thunder: Perfect

  good and evil, light and darkness, truth and error, if Wisdom Herself had not 
  descended into the Darkness of the Human Soul to draw it down to those places

  In the name of <i>progress</i>, for instance, the church acts hand in hand with 
  those who are literally destroying and scarring the face of the Divine Mother. 
  Is She not, in one of Her many manifestations, the Holy Mother Planet Earth 
  Herself? And side by side with these destroyers the American church has also 
  set aside and disregarded the plaintive cries of those who have been made stewards 
  of this Sacred Mystery by God Themselves...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON, D.C.__As she sailed 
    through her Senate confirmation hearing last week, interior secretary nominee 
    Gail Norton played the classic moderate, draping herself with the dual mantles 
    of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;conservationist.&quot; What bull (*!@?$$#!t). 
    A libertarian from the West, Norton has spent the last two decades railing 
    against federal control of public lands and doing all she could to subject 
    their water and energy resources to the bracing reality of the market place. 
    &quot;I hate the government telling me what to do,&quot; she once said. &quot;And 
    I assume other people do.&quot; As Colorado's attorney general in the mid 
    90s, she chalked up a scandalous record: looking the other way in the face 
    of damaging polution, dragging her feet on prosecuting big business, even 
    challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to override state 
    law...In another spectacular case she testified against her own citizens, 
    siding with a big corporation that fouled the air. After years of bouncing 
    between libertarian think tanks <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(think 
    Ayn Rand)</font> and states' rights groups, Norton may finally get the authority 
    to implement her freewheeling ideas on a large, large scale. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James

  a past-recent gathering of Indigenous Peoples, the theme was &quot;The Cry of 
  the Earth.&quot; Many came to speak. The following comments are from notes taken 
  during the conference which was aired on Public Television. These comments--and 
  may we add to them Al Gore's <i>The Earth in the Balance, Ecology and the Human 
  Spirit</i>--are an indictment against the entire American Corporate State, including 
  the so-called Environmental Protection Agency. The former because they represent 
  the Voice of God spoken through the living victims of the great American atrocity, 
  this nation's wholly violent and destructive 400-year march into the heart of 
  this sacred continent. The latter because it reminds us plainly that as far 
  as the American Corporate State is concerned it is still &quot;business as usual,&quot; 
  and nothing but &quot;words&quot; spoken over and over again with the same forked 
  tongues. The Corporate State will do nothing that is not in its own financial 
  interest, thus it will do nothing to redeem itself in the eyes of God, as it 
  continues to provoke the Creator (the Great God of War Himself), and to draw 
  the wrath of Nature Herself down upon the whole house...The Divine Mother and 
  Her children will be saved from the ravages of man, and the earth will be healed.

  <p>Statement from Chief Arvol Looking Horse:</p>
  <p> &quot;I, Chief Arvol Looking Horse of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nation 
    would like to offer a statement concerning the violation against the Sacred 
    Sundance Ceremony at Big Mountain, Arizona. The Sacred White Buffalo Calf 
    Bundle that I care for consists of the Seven Sacred Rights and one of them 
    is the Sundance. Because of this responsibility, my work is toward World Peace 
    and Global Healing, as our ceremonies are connected to the Sacred Mother, 
    including her well being preserved for generations to come. The Sacred Tree 
    represents all life upon Mother Earth. A very important protocol in putting 
    up the Sacred Tree with its offerings of prayers for all life including health 
    for our relatives, is that the ceremony and energy must not be broken or stopped. 
    This ceremony has been with Sacred Bundle for nineteen generations. We have 
    shared this ceremony for health and well being with other Indigenous Nations 
    to bring spiritual awareness and strength back to Nations. </p>
  <p>When I heard of the Hopi Nations attitude and violations to a spiritual 
    ceremony, I had to realize that it was not the Hopi Nation, but rather a group 
    of people who have been affected by the disease of the mind. This disease 
    that has spread throughout Turtle Island to many Honorable Nations that have 
    made decisions affecting relationships toward their own brothers and sisters 
    of Indigenous Nations, including the violation toward our Mother Earth. </p>
  <p>In my Peace works I was honored to sit with many Hopi Traditional Elders, 
    including the late Thomas Banyanca, who had the most deepest respect for all 
    ceremonies, as we shared the Sacred Canupa together. We understood that our 
    work and message was the same. His concern for his people violating their 
    own culture and traditions was the same as mine. There are many other Traditional 
    Hopi who understand the proper protocol to ceremonies and would not think 
    and do anything toward violating one another in interrupting a Sacred Right. 
    So this brings my thoughts to those who do not understand who they are as 
    a Hopi, a person that holds a bloodline to their Ancestors that walked in 
    honor and in harmony. Many Nations, have these kinds of people that are not 
    aware of the blood that carry in their veins and responsibility to bring honor 
    to their people by making wise decisions based on compassion, understanding 
    and respect. This makes me realize that the people making these decisions 
    have another motive based on the material world, which brings unbalance to 
    our Mother the Earth. They only need to understand that these prayers made 
    at all ceremonies are for their childrens health as well. Prayers need to 
    be offered for our people that have become lost in their spirit and identity 
    as an Indigenous Nation of this Turtle Island. Our prayers are strong and 
    to react the same as them will not resolve anything, but bring more division 
    and confusion. </p>

    to all Nations represented will heal and communicate for Peace and Harmony. 
    In a Sacred Hoop of Life, where there is no ending and beginning! Mitakuye 
    Oyasin (all my relations), </p>
  <p>From: Black Hills Woman PAULA H </p>
  <p>Subject: response of a question of why? </p>
  <p>Someone just asked Arvol why all this is happening and whether it was because 
    our Elders are few...from his book &quot;White Buffalo Teachings&quot;: </p>
  <p>We must understand the two ways we are free to follow, as we choose the positive 
    way or the negative way the spiritual way or the material way. Its our own 
    choice--each of ours and all of ours. You yourself are the one who must decide. 
    You alone and only you--can make this crucial choice. Whatever you decide 
    is what youll be, to walk in honor or to dishonor your relatives. You cant 
    escape the consequences of your own decision. On your decision yes, on your 
    own personal decision depends the fate of the entire World. We are the only 
    species destroying Mother Earth! You must decide. You cant avoid it. Each 
    of us is put here in this time and this place to personally decide the future 
    of humankind. Did you think the Creator would create unnecessary people in 
    a time of such terrible danger? </p>
  <p>My Grandmother once told me to understand that every person can have a good 
    heart, a heart big enough to change the world! She said the Great Spirit wouldnt 
    give us something we couldnt handle! Know that you yourself are essential 
    to this World. Believe that! Understand both the blessing and the burden of 
    that. You yourself are desperately needed to save the soul of this World. 
    Did you think you were put here for something less? </p>
  <p>We carry a Message that has been handed down to us from Elder to Elder through 
    the generations, a sacred Message of a Way of Life that Wakan Tankan the Great 
    Spirit, the Great enveloping Mystery, has blessed us with. Each generation 
    has an obligation to pass this Message down to the next. </p>
  <p>Because our Word like the breath of Life that carries it--is sacred, it must 
    always passed down in truth. We do this in our ceremonies, our prayers, our 
    prophecies and our sacred teachings. </p>
  <p>In our way, a leader has to be humble and think about the Seventh Generation. 
    Every generation must consider the welfare of the Seventh Generation yet to 
    come. As we turn to the four cardinal directions, we hear our Ancestors in 
    the winds, encouraging us to make decisions based on generations to come. 
    Remember, seven generations ago our Grandfathers and Grandmothers prayed for 
    our welfare, even though we werent yet born. If they had forgotten those 
    who were not yet born, if they had forgotten us, we wouldnt be here today. 
  </p>
  <p>One of our prophecies warns that, if there comes a time when people would 
    wake up to each new day with continuous negative energy, it would adversely 
    affect the path of a Wakan Ye-ja (a sacred spirit child) coming into this 
    world, and the new life would return back to the spirit world. We witness 
    this many times today when children die before they are born. Yes, we ourselves 
    are the Seventh Generation, and we too, must remember those who arent yet 
    born, the Seventh Generation yet to come. </p>
  <p>The Seventh Generation is now upon us. Every generation is the Seventh Generation, 
    and each generation has its special task, its Instructions. </p>
  <p>Ours is global healing through World Peace and Prayer. That is this generations 
    task. That is my task and that, my friend, is your task, too. Our Instructions 
    from Wakan Tankan tell us to promote global healing, to teach peace and harmony 
    to the many Nations of Mother Earth and to begin both a Great Healing and 
    a Great Forgiving. We must teach all Peoples that Mother Earth is not a resource, 
    but the very Source of Life itself. Unless we do this, the powers of destruction 
    will overwhelm us. </p>
  <p>So our generation has been put here to save all future generations. Thats 
    why we hold this World Peace &amp; Prayer Day each year since 1996, because 
    two years before that the White Buffalo Calf was born among us as a Sign both 
    of Warning and of Deliverance. In a Prophecy, we were told we would be the 
    key people to re-educate our relatives, teaching the medicines of balance 
    and harmony that our Mother Earth needs to survive. Thats why I say that 
    we are at a Crossroads, each of us and all of us a Crossroads predicted in 
    our Prophecies. </p>
  <p>We ourselves stand at the very Crossroads of understanding the positive and 
    negative influences that affect all Life yet to come. We ourselves--you and 
    me and all of us must make the right decision on behalf of the Seventh Generation. 
    But we have little time. </p>
  <p>These days time moves too fast for us to catch up. Babies are having babies. 
    Today we have seven generations in a single century instead of over two or 
    even three. We become grandfathers and grandmothers when we're not yet out 
    of our thirties. When so many of our People die young, those who remain must 
    become Elders. We go from being children to being Elders. There's no in-between, 
    no teaching ground. </p>
  <p>Long ago, we lived to be over one hundred years old, and now our lives have 
    been cut short. There was once an understanding that we would each go through 
    four stages in life after we are born upon this Mother Earth as a Wakan ye-ja 
    (a sacred child). We would have the life span needed to complete the four 
    balanced cycles of life, which is also represented in our Medicine Wheel. 
    We had time to learn the full meaning of becoming a young man or becoming 
    a young woman. We had time to earn our true spirit-name, time to perform the 
    good deeds that brought us a well-deserved Eagle Feather. Above all, learning 
    the meaning of patience, being humble, respectful and understanding the teachings 
    that would bring us to full maturity, so that one might finally become an 
    Elder, a Keeper of Wisdom. This span once took a hundred years or more. Now 
    time is fore-shortened, and we must learn in days or weeks what once took 
    us months or years.&quot;</p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The roots of Indigenous 
  spirituality reach deep into the bosom of Mother Earth, and reach high into 
  the Sky of the Mind of the Creator, connecting all things in the natural and 
  supernatural worlds. It is a branch (or rather the root) of Hebrew thought that 
  the remainder of us have been sent here again to explore, and to be instructed 
  in. But the impulse to tread lightly, and to learn, was quickly overwhelmed 
  by the onrushing force of Darkness, by the more natural urge to exploit, to 
  kill, and to steal. (Read <i>Genocide Against The Indians, Its Role in the Rise 
  of U.S. Capitalism</i>, by George Novack). In the great School of Life, however, 
  no other form of instruction would have sufficed. For only now can we fully 
  understand why Nature is risen up everywhere around us and against us. The great 
  Transgression began with Columbus and the other Spanish Conquistadors, and the 
  Latin church that supported them; and moved right up the Atlantic coast with 
  the English, the Dutch and the French; and then inwards along rivers and forests, 
  mountains and plains, until it reached the Pacific. It is still underway in 
  the continuing saga of modern venture-capitalism, with its now more-rapid, more-mindless, 
  and more-obscene surge of development--highways to everywhere, travel plazas, 
  malls, condos, sports complexes, business and entertainment complexes, entertainment, 
  ENTERTAINMENT!, A-musements, Neon lights, business, fast-food chains, entertainment, 
  cartoons everywhere, MINDLESS CARTOONS, A-musements, awards, sitcoms, sports, 
  more sports, more awards, business logos, sports logos, advertisements everywhere, 
  more and more advertisements, consumption, production, destruction, bulldozers 
  on every hillside, clearcutting, strip-mining, mountain-top removing, paving, 
  concreting, cutting, fertilizing, chemicals draining off into the waterways, 
  poisoning everything, cancer, cutting, building, hamburgers, french fries, consuming, 
  investing, more consuming, more investing, more destroying, traffic, cars everywhere, 
  more traffic, more malls, more buying, more and more traffic...We are not of 
  sound mind. We are politically, economically, technologically and spiritually 
  INSANE. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">No wonder so many Indigenous 
  peoples do not take others serious. The people show up at pow wows, drum circles, 
  and vision-quest &quot;weekends&quot; with ATM and Visa cards in their back 
  pockets, without even realizing the discrepancy. We want to live in both worlds, 
  in the spirit-world of our own longing imagination, and the corporate world 
  of the American imagination, with its demonic delusions of unbridled economic 
  growth. It is well that Nature has the solution to these things at hand--great

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not realizing how the 
  Mother Principle went into occultation with the rise of the Solar principle 
  in the time of Christ (taking her mysteries with her), the orthodox structures 
  that came to power afterwards nearly relegated her to nonexistence, allowing 
  her little more status than that of a handmaiden. She is allowed to light the 
  Sabbath candles, and even in our time to serve as an altar girl (a practice 
  which the Vatican has recently tried to discourage). But in other places She 
  is breaking down the barriers altogether. &quot;To do justice to the mystery 
  of God,&quot; says Elizabeth Johnson, in her <i>She Who Is</i>, &quot;we need 
  a whole treasury of metaphors:&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Metaphor is an important 
    word in all of this. No one in this debate is claiming that God is a man or 
    a woman, God transcends such definitions. The debate is over how God is viewed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off 'its political,' she 
    said. 'God is the highest symbol in any religious system. Viewing God always 
    as male hashes out politically as viewing the male in a higher position. If 
    you start rethinking--that female can also be highest--it transfers very quickly 
    to human relationships.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisdom is seen as Mother to all 
    things. 'She reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other, and 
    orders all things well.' The Bible says, as a Spirit she passes into holy 
    souls and makes them friends of God.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johnson takes this to give a new 
    model of the Trinity. She likens this spirit to the Holy Spirit. Jesus acquires 
    a feminine dimension by being viewed as a human incarnation of divine Wisdom. 
    And God the Father becomes, in Johnson's terminology, Holy Wisdom, Mother 
    of the Universe...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johnson said she's not opposed 
    to viewing God in masculine terms, but she'd like to give that tradition a 
    long rest. She encourages a view of God who is near, closely related to the 
    people who suffer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asked how she would rewrite the 
    old Baltimore Catechism definition of God: 'God is the Supreme Being who made 
    all things.' She said it remains a good answer. But the offer proved too good 
    to turn down, and continued: 'I think I would add, and who is neither male 
    nor female, but created both in the divine image.' She paused, and added with 
    a smile that one could also say: 'God is the Supreme Mother who made all things, 
    who gave birth to the world.'&quot; <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Caitlin Matthews, in her 
  <i>Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom, the Divine Feminine from Black Goddess to World 
  Soul</i>, brings Her from beyond the veil of Ezekiel 16 and Revelation 17 to 
  Her descending glory at Revelation 21. As the symbolisms transform themselves 
  in our minds we must in turn be transformed by them:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our's is the knowing ignorance 
    of the child in its mother's womb. We have to be born and we are frightened 
    by the extra-womb dimension. Out of the womb we begin to be terrified by our 
    origins, but one of the prophecies of Sophia is 'I will give thee the treasures 
    of darkness, and the divine riches of secret places.' Those treasures of the 
    Divine Feminine lie deep within us, waiting to be discovered. (p.17).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mystical Christianity has always 
    kept the doors open for Sophia to go in and out. Where Sophia has been there 
    I have followed...Gnosis speaks of Sophia as the Woman with three measures 
    of meal. I BELIEVE SHE KNOWS JUST WHEN THE DOUGH IS RISEN, AND WHEN THE TIME 
    COMES EVERY FORM OF SPIRITUALITY WILL KNOW ABOUT HER IN WAYS UNDREAMED OF. 
    (p.2).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the emphasis is loaded for the 
    West it is because Sophia is most needed and least appreciated here. My purpose 
    is to give Wisdom a voice, for she calls aloud in the city looking for her 
    beloved, and few listen. (p.2).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We in the West are haunted by the 
    loss of our Mother. Our Mother country is a place we have never (consciously) 
    visited, though it is endlessly projected as a paradise. But if the Goddess 
    has been displaced from her territorial home all this long while, where has 
    She been residing in the interim? (p.5).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We didn't invent the Goddess, She 
    has always been there from the beginning...Somehow humanity left home and 
    forgot its Mother. Perhaps our ancestors took her for granted so much that 
    they lost touch? Well our generation wants to come home now and be part of 
    the family in a more loving way. Because the West still has a lot of growing 
    up to do, and the Goddess has a lot to teach us. (p.15).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For women the tide is turning. 
    Throughout the history of Western spirituality, images of the Divine Mother 
    of Life recur, showing that the loss of paradise is more than balanced by 
    the quest for knowledge, the Wisdom which inhabits Life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sophia also appears in the surprising 
    guise of a harlot...The image is perfectly reasonable in the context of gnosis 
    for she is a woman of knowledge...'It is I who am the harlot, and the holy,' 
    says the Thunder Perfect voice of Sophia. The image of the whore and the holy 
    one are as interblent within Gnosis as they are throughout Biblical tradition. 
    Rahab the harlot helped Joshua's men escape from Jericho and became an ancestor 
    of Mary. She placed her red cord in the window as a sign...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mary Magdalene is familiar to us 
    from the Gospels as the archetypal harlot...she has been conflated with the 
    Woman taken in Adultery, the Anointing Woman, and others. All that Luke 8:2 
    tells us is that the Magdalene was one 'from whom Seven devils had gone out.' 
    Jesus frequently exorcised the sick of such possession, but it is not without 
    significance that Mary should possess Seven devils...This statement establishes 
    Mary as someone who has already reached perfection according to the Gnostic 
    ideal...Like Sophia, this has left Mary with two personas: as the Bride of 
    Christ in mysticism and the fallen maiden of social reality. (pp.165-69).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As more women and men meditate 
    upon Sophia they discover their own lost wisdom. It is a long process of stripping 
    off the veils one by one. It is a journey of descent, a valorous fall in order 
    to remember.&quot; (p.33).</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The challenge emerging today 
    demands a Copernican revolution; a new theology of Judaism, requiring a new 
    understanding of God, revelation, halakah, and the Jewish people, in order 
    to support and encourage change. (p.xxiii).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The essays in this volume examine 
    images of women in various facets of contemporary Jewish life. Taken together 
    they reveal that older, biblical, rabbinical, and medieval images continue 
    to thrive...These images reveal not who women are, but how women are made 
    to appear and function from a male-dominated perspective.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When opponents describe the sexual 
    danger of ordaining women as rabbis, for example...they unconsciously draw 
    on ancient Jewish legends, such as those describing the mysterious, threatening 
    power of Lilith, the mythical female demon. In their struggle with contemporary 
    discrimination, feminists are actually wrestling with these unspoken hidden 
    images which often keep the community from making changes even though no rules 
    forbid them. (p.xxxi)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly there is a need for reinterpretation 
    in Judaism if women are to be transformed from subject to object...Theology 
    must apply feminine concerns in examining the meaning of religious symbols, 
    traditions, and beliefs, and strive to give answers to ultimate questions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religious beliefs and observances 
    have life cycles of their own. They may take different shapes, flourish or 
    wane. Some die because of their incredibility or irrelevance, others receive 
    new life through reinterpretation...by creating a framework for understanding 
    larger questions of revelation, tradition, authority, and change. (p.xxxii).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The treatment in Judaism of women 
    derives not from the Torah...but from its misinterpretation by rabbis throughout 
    the centuries. (p.115).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conservatism claims to employ a 
    perennial historical consciousness of the Jewish people as a guide to religious 
    observances and belief. Jewish law, while held to be divinely inspired, may 
    be interpreted according with that consciousness...Problematic is the fact 
    that this historic consciousness has yet to be defined. Does it refer to the 
    experience of the Jewish people or to the Jewish leaders?... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The halakhic scholar who advises 
    these improvements considers them to be advancements under the sheltering 
    bough of the 'Torah's spirit and truth,' and these suggestions, he points 
    out--segregated study, segregated minyanim, segregated celebration--do not 
    violate halakhah, because they flow from the halakhic premise of separation, 
    which in turn flows from the notion--in his words--'different rights and responsibilities 
    do not necessarily imply inferior value.'...If it is not inferior value, why 
    is it to be kept apart? (pp.138,39).</font></p>

    to rid itself of the 'demons' of false image, and observes a Holy Body Day 
    to counter men's degradation of women's 'impure' bodies. On that day the women 
    pray that they will be restored to their own temple, that they will no longer

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Half of Judeao-Christianity's 
  dilemma (and by extension a greater part of Islam's dilemma) can be attributed 
  to its orthodoxy, its inflexibility, its literalism, thus to its inability to 
  come to terms with the allegorical, and the epic dimensions of the Torah (and 
  by extension the Qur'an); or with the epic, and spiritual expanse of the City 
  of Jerusalem; thus with the completely spiritual dimensions of history itself. 
  (But it couldn't act in any other way. It was bound by invisible forces larger 
  than itself, all of which have been acting together in the very interest of 
  Creation--for the human mind is, at this moment, still being created. It is

  furnace of 20th century events...Genesis 15:5-16). (The solutions to all things 
  is about to appear in the great design).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Talmudic Judaism has taught 
  itself that Christianity is an aberration in the spiritual scheme of things, 
  as if God had nothing better to do with the last two thousand years of human 
  history than to waste it away, or worse yet, than to let all that time get away 
  from Them, beyond Their control, as if They had no power over such things. And 
  Christians, by imagining that Christianity, as it has organized and revealed 
  itself since the time of Christ, is an expression of the spirit of Christ in 
  the world rather than Antichrist. It is the spirit of Antichrist through and 
  through, from head to foot--from the time of Constantine and Catholicism in 
  all of its historic and schismatic forms; across all of the events of the Reformation, 
  to the greatest practitioners of Ba'al of all time the American Church and all 
  the worldlings who have risen to the top of it. The Scriptures are clear where 
  they say that God would reduce each side (both Jews and Christians) to a remnant 
  in our time, and that no one should act with authority over others in spiritual 
  matters, or to even imagine that they themselves knew anything specific about 
  the ultimate meanings of things, beyond a certain realization that each had 
  been apportioned--for both good and evil--a part of the mystery to safeguard 
  until the last days. <i>By faith, not by sight,</i> Paul said. Thus those who 
  had authority should always have acted as <i>good shepherds </i>keeping their 
  flocks from harm's way--especially from the ways of warriors and other surreptitiously 
  violent men--and always as the <i>learned </i> who, when the book was brought 
  to them to read, said <i>I cannot for it is sealed</i>. (Isaiah 29:10-12)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus the truly learned 
  have always said: &quot;Until such a time as God will reveal the whole of it 
  we will maintain what little we do know, it is enough. We will keep searching 
  deeper for the meaning of things as we have been instructed, we will be attentive 
  to the signs of the times, but most of all we will keep our hands from violence 
  and bloodshed, from oppression, and from evil in all of its forms as best as 
  we understand it.&quot; (The Sayings of the Fathers; 1 Peter 1:1-5; 2 Peter 
  3:14-18). In this proper attitude of obedience and humility before the Written 
  Word the curtains are expanded, and everyone, and every insight and idea founded 
  in the Word, is--for the time being--correct, and we may live by them. Faith 
  would, indeed, have become the guiding and sustaining principle. The problems 
  arose when one or another group felt compelled to monopolize the interpretation 
  of the Word and define its meanings for everyone else, and when others in turn 
  felt bound, or imprisoned by such a particular interpretation or another, being 
  forced now as they were to answer to men rather than God for their beliefs and 
  their actions--especially when they could plainly see that those who gained 
  the ascendancy were apostate, or shortsighted and narrow-minded, and most certainly 
  in our time the friends of violent and destructive men.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In terms of the question 
  &quot;Why is it to be kept apart?&quot; we must actually come in partial defense 
  of the rabbis here, but only by recalling for them (and for the rest of us as 
  well), what they would not, or could not comprehend. It has to do with the hidden 
  structure of the Tree of Life, and with the realization that our thought-patterns, 
  and therefore our rituals and liturgy, were being formalized in the image of 
  that Reality, thus with things that could not be reconciled in the orthodox 
  mind until the fulness of time. The Oracle, is divided into two symmetrical 
  halves. One side of the Tree is male, the other side is female. The Sun and 
  Moon are ancient reflections of this essential spiritual reality. The two were 
  placed, not only in the material heavens above but in the corresponding heavens 
  of human comprehension, to draw our minds upwards to the higher meaning of things. 
  Thus in our pursuit of such meanings we have discovered that the two are not 
  only universal reflections of the Male and Female principles, but in our very 
  own day they reflect the division that also exists between Christianity on the 
  one hand, and Judaism on the other...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to rabbinic 
  tradition Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyarcanus was a disciple of Yochannan ben Zakkai, 
  who was said to be a disciple of Hillel, the great expositor of the Torah in 
  the time of Christ. We shall see that Yochannan ben Zakkai and the Essene, John 
  (Yochannan) the Baptist (the &quot;son of Zachariah&quot;), were one and the 
  same, or rather that the Yochannan of rabbinic fame acquired the name after 
  the Kabbalistic doctrines of the early Church passed into Judaism via the original 
  Schimon bar Yonah (Simon Peter) and others, and that this Rabbi Eliezer was 
  one of chief agents of these transmissions. His association with the Essenes, 
  the first Christians, and possibly with Paul (Elisha Ben Abuyah), was the eventual 
  cause of his censure and excommunication from the rabbinic circle. Nevertheless, 
  in a work ascribed to him many centuries later entitled <i>The Chapters of Rabbi 
  Eliezer the Great</i>, there are two chapters dedicated to the course of the 
  Sun and the Moon, and another concerned with the intercalation periods between 
  them both...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">These chapters seem primarily 
  concerned with assuring that these two luminous bodies appear in the heavens 
  together when they are supposed to, marking the times and the seasons in their 
  proper order, so that Passover is always observed in the spring of the year, 
  and the High Holy Days of the Seventh month are always observed when the Sun 
  is falling in the West at the time of the Autumn equinox. But a closer examination 
  reveals these chapters to be actually concerned with the conjunction of the 
  Male and Female principles in their appointed times. In these chapters we are 
  told that the Sun's path through the planetary spheres is a cycle of 28 years, 
  bringing it back to its place of origin again--a cycle that has continued since 
  the time these two great lights were created together in the Genesis account. 
  (Genesis 1:16). And that the cycle of the Moon is 21 years, before it returns 
  to its place of origin in respect to the other planets again. Starting out together, 
  according to this purely apocryphal account, it means that the two must come 
  together every (28 X 21) 588 years. Ten times 588 years is 5,880 years...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/LawOfMoses.gif" width="577" height="438"></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Likewise, when we calculate 
  the times according to their Jubilees (periods of 49 years each, as we are commanded 
  to at Leviticus 25:8), we see that the whole time of the Adamic epic (from Genesis 
  to Revelation) is also (120 X 49), or 5,880 years. And in this circle we discover 
  <a href="../UsedImages/pg175.gif">three periods</a> of 40 Jubilees each: a period 
  of 40 Jubilees between the time of Adam to the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
  40 Jubilees more to the time of Christ, and 40 Jubilees, or 1,960 years, from 
  the time of Christ to our own, and to another of the <a href="SideLinks/Astrology.htm">many 
  cosmic events</a> that are falling in place together at this time in history--all 
  of which have everything to do with the joining together in our time of the

  to mention, Things Above with Things Below.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And neither may our strictly 
  literalist brethren go to calculating in order to prove such things incorrect--jot, 
  tittle, seconds, minutes, hours, days--for all the times and events of God have 
  their own complexities, and their own catching up with each other to do. Be 
  sure that all things are locking in place together, but also that Divine Grace 
  still presides over the wheels of Time, and over the whole process of revelation:</font></p>

  (the <i>Messiah/Moshiac</i>, who will be manifest together in the composite

  history could not have unfolded as it has; the Terrible Presence of God could 
  not have been revealed to world as it has in the 20th century; and the Gentiles 
  (everyone is a Gentile until they enter the mystery of the Covenant...on their

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At no time over the course 
  of this age could these scriptures have been fulfilled in Judaism, only in Christianity. 
  Knowing this, the other side of the early Church--the Judaic side of the Church, 
  initially presided over by Jacob (James the Just) and Simeon (Simon Peter)--left 
  Paul to his work and went into occultation with Judaism itself, taking their 
  <i>merkabah </i> mysteries and kabbalistic doctrines with them (purposfully 
  sealed as they were from the world at large--even from Judaism at large). These 
  doctrines emerged here and there, mixing with those of the various Gnostic schools 
  and fellowships of Merkabah mystics, but finally in the spirit of the seventeenth-century 
  Hasidic movement in Central and Eastern Europe, whose adherents are now primarily 
  situated here in America. (Jeremiah 24). Thus the words: <i>This child is set 
  for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel</i> (Luke 2:34). &quot;Rising 
  again&quot; because it will be seen that the Messiahs of D.V.D. are children 
  of this very same Hasidic tradition, as Paul, again, says: <i>Boast not against 
  the natural branches...For God is able to graff them back in again.</i> (Romans 
  11:15-23). Luke also wrote of those who rejected the doctrine of Christ in those 
  times, choosing instead to walk in the more literal ways of the Torah: <i>No 
  man also having drunk old wine STRAIGHTAWAY desireth new, for he saith the old 
  is better. </i>(Luke 5:39). And Clement, also initiated into these things, says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Neither are the Hebrews (the 
    Jews) condemned on account of their ignorance of (YHShWH) by reason of Him 
    who concealed him, if doing the things commanded by Moses, they do not hate 
    him who they know not. Neither are those from among the Gentiles condemned 
    who know not Moses on account of Him who concealed him, provided that these 
    also, doing the things spoken by YHShWH, do not hate whom they do not know.&quot;

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The doctrines of the Kabbalah, 
  upon which both Christianity and modern Judaism hang, can be traced historically 
  from the early first century, across the pages of history, to our own present 
  time in the West, to the Feet of the Oracle, and to the words: <i>And the books 
  were opened.</i> (Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12). They can also be traced to 
  the words: <i>And I will give power unto my two witnesses.</i> (Revelation 11:3)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Who are these witnesses? 
  One must see it in the Oracle. (Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15; Isaiah 43:10,12; Matthew 
  18:16; 1 Corinthians 13:1). They are every soul, male and female alike (Jew, 
  Christian, and all others from every religious tradition alike) who have ever 
  entered into the Mysteries of the Tree of Life, and into this Great Circle of 
  historical events, and specifically from the time of Aaron and Moses to our 
  own time (and who, as a result, have ever testified to the things that have 
  been coming to pass in the earth--many at the expense of their own well-being, 
  and in peril of their own mortal lives). This Circle was one of which the number 
  Seven provided the natural cosmic as well as geometric base, and also the far-off 
  moment in time in which the Circle would be complete. Thus Moses wrote: </font></p>

  full-circle back to Eden, back to the Western ends of the earth, and to the 
  Seventh emanation on the Tree of Life named Endurance. The circle(s) used in 
  this prophetic narrative is one of 360 degrees, or 360 units of time. This symbolic 
  measurement is used consistently in the books of Daniel and Revelation and is 
  in keeping with the mysteries of ancient Babylon. It divides the Circle of the 
  Year into four even quadrants of three months each. (There are also 840 segments 
  of the number seven in the great 5,580 year circle...It is the number Seven 
  that is common to both of these circles). When we multiply 360 by the Seven 
  times around the city, we have 2,520 units of time. The 2,520 units of time 
  can also be divided into 84 figurative months of 30 days each. (2,520 &divide; 
  30 = 84) Half of these 84 months is 42 months, or 1,260 days. With these figures 
  in mind--along with the realization that the time from John the Baptist to our 
  time on the Tree of Life is figuratively half of the time, or half the distance 
  that exists on the Tree of Life from the time of Aaron and Moses to our own--we 
  can begin to interpret the meanings of the words...</font></p>

  only into the transcendent realm of the Tree of Life, but into the mystery of 
  his own reincarnation in the last day. Thus he says: <i>We which are alive and

  as it was in order to manifest and separate the spirit of Light in the last 
  days from the spirit of Darkness, he saw that there are commandments in the 
  Law which, when followed literally, allow men to do what is already in their 
  sinful hearts to do--to exact vengeance, to oppress others, and to kill. <i>Oh

  any of the other politicians, great and small, thugs and warlords, who are risen 
  up in the earth in the name of religion in our time. Any one of them could qualify. 
  (In fact most of them, in their own twisted ways, actually believe that they 
  are messiahs). In this sense the literal David of the Scriptures--the purely 
  male David--though he might be considered an heroic statesman by today's standards, 
  is also a marauding despoiler, he is boastful, he is violent, vindictive, vengeful, 
  and double-minded. He is an executioner, a concubinizer, and an adulterer. These 
  are hardly the qualities we imagine that God would require of one who is about 
  to inherit the throne of &quot;his father David,&quot; and who is about to be 
  raised up as the Messiah in our time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But when we see this David 
  in epic, as well as in purely allegorical and kabbalistic terms--in light of 
  the Mystery of Christ of which <i>he</i> plays so great a part, thus as a didactic 
  literary figure, one also created to instruct us in every negative as well as 
  positive way--we understand. We understand why the Psalms of David--and the 
  118th Psalm in particular--are placed directly in the Center of the King James 
  Version of the Scriptures. David is crucified there--right there in the City 
  of David itself. (Psalm 118 is situated between the shortest and longest chapters 
  in the Scriptures). When we see this literal DaViD crucified on the limbs of 
  the Cosmic Tree we see that the qualities intentionally attributed to <i>him</i>, 
  belonging as they do to the lower, unregenerated spirit of all men, are those 
  of which every soul must in turn repent and overcome if it is to be crowned 
  king--if it is to rule over the empire of its own individual existence--and 
  how much more so if it is to be crowned king over the people themselves...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The David of the Old Testament 
  (like the Jesus of the New Testament) is not a single individual, but a whole 
  complex of spiritual principles and ideas embodied in the literary figure of 
  one individual. These principles (primarily the principle of balance and symmetry, 
  as the name David implies) have been struggling to overcome all the other thought-forms, 
  ideas and lower archetypes that have entered into and captured the mind of Israel. 
  The strife between David and Saul for instance, must be seen in the broad allegorical 
  setting in which it is framed. The figure of David is an embodiment of the Higher 
  Mysteries, of the emerging higher state of human undestanding, which are in 
  the continuous process of appearing to the mind of the children of Light. Thus 
  the words: <i>David went out and came in before them. </i>(1 Samuel 18:14-16). 
  The Mysteries &quot;come out&quot; of the narratives to the children of Light, 
  and return inwards when they are approached by the children of Darkness. That 
  the mysteries of D.V.D., and the city of D.V.D., were hidden from history was 
  further expressed in the words: <i>And David built round about from Mil'lo and 
  INWARD. </i>(2 Samuel 5:9). Mil'lo represents the literal text itself, filled 
  with external narrative and literary embellishment, all of which was intended 
  to conceal the core of the secret narrative within...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Saul represents the lower, 
  worldly spirit in Israel--the purely intellectual, the purely ethical. He represents 
  organized religion and political power, as opposed to mystic insight and true 
  spirituality--true Power. Saul (the Flesh) is ever envious of DaViD (the emerging 
  Spirit in man), and ever seeks to kill him. Saul is that form of reasoning which 
  always seeks to keep D.V.D. from becoming king in Israel. (1 Samuel 19:1; Galatians 
  5). The mysteries, then, must <i>abide in a secret place and hide themselves</i> 
  as they have in the narratives of the Hebrew scriptures. (1 Samuel 19:2). Make 
  all the necessary connections now. Study the oracles and put the story together:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="+1">And David said 
    to Jonathan, Behold tomorrow is the </font></i><font size="+1"><i>NEW MOON</i></font><i><font size="+1">, 
    and I should not fail to sit with the king </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(with 
    Saul, the lower reasoning in Israel)</font><i><font size="+1"> at meat. But 
    let me go that I may hide myself in the field UNTO THE THIRD DAY AT EVENING...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Samuel 20:5)</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>And Jonathan said 
    to David, Tomorrow is the NEW MOON, and thou shalt be missed, because thy 
    seat will be empty...</i>(1 Samuel 20:18, 24).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mystery of D.V.D. 
  is hidden until the resurrection of the spiritual mind in Israel in the last 
  day, in the time of the truly New Moon. (Genesis 40:12; Hosea 6:1,2; Ezekiel 
  37). A cave in scripture is not merely a place where mysteries are hidden (Deuteronomy 
  32:34), but it is also the place to which the people must repair (in their own 
  minds) if they are to discover those mysteries again:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="+1">David therefore 
    departed hence, and escaped to the cave Adul'lam: and when his brethren and 
    all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</font></i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="+1">And everyone 
    that was in distress, and everyone that was in debt, and everyone that was 
    discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: 
    and there was with him about </font></i><font size="+1"><i>Four Hundred</i></font><i><font size="+1"> 
    men...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Samuel 22:1,2).</font></font></p>

  symbol of the Great Mandala of the Mystery of Christ <img src="../UsedImages/pg148c.gif" width="30" height="34"> 
  is also the hieroglyph for the letter Taw, which is also equivalent to the number 
  400 in the ancient Paleo-Hebrew script. (Please see the subchapter entitled 
  From Proto-Hebrew to English). Thus the text in Samuel, and its reference to 
  the number Four Hundred, is intended to carry the mind of the spiritual aspirant 
  across the breadth of the entire Mystery, from the East to the West, and from 
  the past to the present. We can also see it in the story of David's pursuit 
  of the Amalakites:</font></p>

  the cares of the world that always attack the minds and the spirit of the people, 
  demoralizing and weighing them down, and especially the weakest and the weariest 
  of the people who are coming up behind. In times like our own these wearing 
  attributes can begin to seem like virtues, and can transform themselves into 
  a kind of (work) ethic that the people accept as normal, and which must for 
  some patriotic or religious reasons be upheld, or endured. (Which in one sense 
  is true...James, chapter 5). In 1 Samuel 15:7-9, Agag, the chief of the Amalekites, 
  represents the highest form of ethics and civility, the very same that have 
  come to characterize Israel's subservient relationship to the other nations--especially 
  here in the capitalist West, in America. And Saul represents that worldly spirit 
  in Israel (the mainline Protestant ethic if you will), and those who take pride 
  in this relationship, in their civic responsibility, and for conservatives in 
  their constant dwelling on the common sins of the common people, imposing upon 
  them an ever-awareness of their responsibility to always uphold the mores and

  the children of Light to perform them...for it is Light that God is creating. 
  (God alone--and only in His most Terrible forms--may take the life of another 
  person, for the Mind of Creation alone knows the true nature of each soul, and 
  the pathway each must take from one life to the next, and the work that every 
  soul performs in the interest of Creation). The account in Samuel, as in the 
  Torah itself, is allegorical. The <i>man</i> we are commanded to slay is that 
  propensity, or inclination, each of us have within ourselves to sow the seed 
  of wrong thought into the heart and mind of another. This we must slay. The 
  <i>woman</i> is that natural inclination each of us have within us to open ourselves 
  up to wrong thought, and to allow it in. We are commanded us to slay these inclinations 
  from within ourselves. The <i>infants</i> and <i>children</i> are &quot;new 
  errors&quot; that are born out of the merger of old errors. Some of them grow 
  up to become giants like the Roman church, or multinational corporations, or 
  the American empire. <i>Sucklings</i> are strange ideas that cling to the philosophies 
  of Israel, thus finding a life of their own inside of the minds and the doctrines 
  of the congregation. Some of these grow up to become our guiding principles 
  and leading lights as well. And the mixed livestock represent the confusion, 
  the philosophies, the sacrifices, as well as the lesser desires and emotions 
  that motivate the other (unspiritual) nations of the earth, which we have been 
  commanded not to partake of...thus to slay. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Scripture says that 
  <i>David fights the battles of the Lord. </i>(1 Samuel 25:28). The words must 
  not be taken literally, because it also says: <i>The Lord is the same, yesterday, 
  today, and forever. </i>(Hebrews 13:8). This means that the Angel of the Lord's 
  Presence--the very same who appeared to the mind of Israel in ancient times, 
  hundreds of years before the time of David (Exodus 19; 23:20-23; 24:9,10; Joshua 
  5:13-15), the very same who does indeed exact judgments and wage literal battles 
  in the earth (Matthew 24), indeed, the very same who flew into the World Trade 
  Center on September 11th (Deuteronomy 32:22-29, 39-42; 2 Samuel 22; Psalm 18:1-10; 
  Isaiah 66:15-18; Hebrews 12:25-29)--would not have the sons and daughters of 
  Light engaged in literal, mortal combat at one time in history--in literal warfare 
  in one age--and then in figurative, or spiritual warfare in another (as some 
  contest). One can look back across the 20th century, and into the East at this 
  present time, and see the effects of such reasoning--into the end of those who 
  desire the ways of human warfare in the name of God, not realizing that they 
  are ignorantly engaged in an (un)holy war against the Spirit of God at the same 
  time. These are all the children of Darkness in the earth. It is this spirit 
  of Darkness (in this case the spirit of Saul)--that God is preparing to judge 
  in the world because of its historic refusal to adhere to the Word of the Lord 
  and to walk in the ways of Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Concerning the <i>mikvah, 
  </i>the Messiahs will dispense with it as a required ritual, as an instrument 
  of assuring &quot;feminine cleanliness&quot;, thus spiritual holiness. Neither 
  menstruation or the bearing of children is unclean...but holy, holy, holy. The 
  mikvah, again, results from an inability to interpret the Torah in epic and 
  historic terms. First of all the issue of a &quot;woman's&quot; menses in the 
  Torah has nothing to do with the Female gender, save that females bear in their 
  bodies the physical manifestations of the metaphor, but rather with the soul--male 
  and female alike--(and primarily with the religious institutions they belong 
  to) who is either pregnant with spiritual understanding or barren of it. The 
  World-church of Revelation, chapter 17, ruled almost entirely by males, is barren 
  of it, and stains the world with &quot;her&quot; continual flow of blood...With 
  the continual flow of the blood of her sons and daughters that is. (Revelation 
  17; Ezekiel 16; Leviticus 15:18-33).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What this <i>woman</i>, 
  who imagines herself to be the keeper of the oracles of God, did not know is 
  that when Israel went up into the Tree of Life--up into the State of Mind that 
  was promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--the first time under Joshua and Caleb, 
  it was entering into the great Mother period of the Nation's history. Miriam 
  (Mary--the Mysteries of the Sea) led them forth with singing and dancing. And 
  then Deborah (whose name flows from the Six-sided honeycomb, thus Tipheret on 
  the Tree of Life) became a &quot;Mother in Israel.&quot; She represents the 
  Feminine mythology of that whole ancient period. (Judges 5). The Mother, of 
  course, gave birth to the Son--the next period in the Nation's history, which 
  began in the time of Christ and is now coming to a close.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE RED HEIFER...Without 
  spot or blemish, having never been yoked...Indeed, not so much as having ever 
  been seen since the time of Christ. (Numbers, chapter 19). This Heifer represents 
  all of the mysteries (all of the natural symbolism) in which the Divine Mother 
  who is descending again into our collective field of consciousness is clothed. 
  She is descending to Her own children (the Calves in the stall...Malachi 4). 
  How, if She is the Divine Mother (open the second chapter of the Holy Qur'an), 
  is She now a heifer? Because She herself is Her own daughter. And because this 
  daughter, being a virgin in every metaphorical sense of the word, having never 
  been penetrated (or defiled as the outer mysteries have), is alone capable of 
  purifying Israel. Why is she Red? Like her Mother Kali in the East (who is ablaze 
  with judgment--blood and water, fire and earth), this one, knowing the Face 
  of her Mother, has preserved herself for the Fire and her ordinances for the 
  restoration of the children of Light. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She will be burned in 
  the Fires of the Great Suttee...with the cedar wood (of Lebanon...see Ezekiel 
  31); with hyssop (that &quot;springs out of the wall&quot;...1 Kings 4:33. This 
  is the planting of the Mystery that continually breaks forth from its own hiding 
  place within the walls of the Holy City); and with scarlet (for the sins of 
  the people...Isaiah 1:18). Her ashes, as the atoning blood of Christ itself 
  (as the Evening Sacrifice), is sprinkled Seven times.</font> </p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those who have attempted 
  to penetrate her mysteries, or to sacrifice her (in any literal way) are unclean 
  till the Evening (till the going down of the Sun at the end of the age--till 
  the revelation of every hidden thing). He that touches the Dead Body of any 
  Man <a href="../UsedImages/pg152.gif">(and every single soul is guilty)</a> 
  shall be unclean these same Seven days. They shall purify themselves on the 
  3rd day and on the 7th. (These are both the same day). One who is clean (of 
  the great transgression) shall gather up her ashes (all of her meanings), and 
  her (meanings) shall be used in the waters of separation. (2 Corinthians 6:14-18; 
  Revelation 18). </font></p>
