  OF THE END?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some Predict Rapture, 
  and Many Aren't Taking Any Chances</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA, September 
    11, 1988__Today, the dawn of what some say may be the beginning of the end, 
    some believers are following the motto: Be Prepared. If the local believers 
    have calculated correctly, Jesus Christ will arrive to take them to heaven 
    and leave behind the heathen, an event they call the Rapture. If not today, 
    they predict, he'll be here at least by Tuesday evening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One area church has experienced 
    a surge in baptisms in preparation for Sept. 11-13, the days during which 
    writer Ed Whisenant predicts the apocalypse will start. &quot;This is not 
    a cult about the end of the world. We are not marching around with placards,&quot; 
    the Rev. Edwin S. Harper said. &quot;If you had this information, it would 
    be foolish not to do anything about it--my position is one of caution.&quot; 
    Harper's Staunton Street Apostolic Church ran a full page ad in the Huntington-Dispatch 
    warning of the Rapture. He said that although the Bible states no one can 
    know the exact date, &quot;it only makes sense to be prepared.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only will there be a physical 
    exodus from the earth, the Bible says, but the dead who placed their faith 
    in Christ as Savior during their lifetime will rise from their graves before 
    seven years of war, pestilence and disease begin, Harper said...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm not knocking their belief,&quot; 
    said Dr. E.S. Hanrahan, dean of the College of Science at Marshall University, 
    &quot;the Bible is a marvelous book, but it is subject to interpretation.&quot; 
    Then why are so many people treating this latest date so seriously? &quot;It's 
    just a sign of our times--people are looking for reassurance that it isn't 
    going to happen...We have the capability to the end the world now--with nuclear 
    war--and we've been living with that for a long time,&quot; Hanrahan said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whisenant's booklet, distributed 
    by the World Bible Society...is in two parts titled &quot;On Borrowed Time,&quot; 
    and &quot;88 Reasons Why the Rapture Could be in 1988.&quot; In his booklet, 
    Whisenant says he used mathematics, the Bible and other things to arrive at 
    the date of the beginning of the end...Harper said he learned the importance 
    of today's date in 1975, &quot;when it became very apparent we were coming 
    very close to the 40th anniversary of Israel becoming a nation.&quot;...In 
    his booklet, Whisenant points out that Rosh Hashana--the Jewish New Year--will 
    be celebrated this year from sunset September 11 to sunset September 13, the 
    days he predicted for the Rapture...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as Marshall astronomer Nicholas 
    Orsini points out...&quot;as for today, nothing is going to happen. There 
    is nothing in the heavens that is ominous at this time...But if it's divine 
    intervention, it's beyond me to predict it.&quot; </font>Monty Fowler, The

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SYMBOLIC MEANING TO 
  RAPTURE TEACHING. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LETTER TO THE EDITOR__If someone 
    could grab the church by the shoulders and shake some correct interpretation 
    into it, and its fixation with the literal word out of it, and if one could 
    also shake it out of the garments of intellectual pride in which it is clothed, 
    it might learn how to interpret the meaning of the event it is calling &quot;the 
    Rapture.&quot; It might learn what it means to be &quot;caught up.&quot; Caught 
    up to what? And to where? Into the Air, Paul says at 1 Thessalonians 4:17. 
    But what does he mean? Paul is a son of the Torah, a child of the Prophets. 
    He was no foreigner to the symbolic language employed by those ancients, and 
    he employs it here when he paraphrases Moses&quot; &quot;Ye have seen what 
    I did unto the Egyptians, AND HOW I BARE YOU ON EAGLE'S WINGS, AND BROUGHT 
    YOU UNTO MYSELF.&quot; (Exodus 19:4).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The children of Israel did not 
    &quot;disappear&quot; from the earth in those times, but they <i>were </i>&quot;caught 
    up&quot; to God. The prophets tell us that once again will the Spirit of God 
    be poured out upon all flesh (Joel 2:28), and Paul is describing in symbolic 
    language how the spirit in man rises up to meet it. He says the same at 2 
    Corinthians 12 and 13, where he describes his own &quot;rapture&quot; to the 
    Third Heaven, where he saw and heard things that were then unlawful to reveal. 
    But he did not leave the earth in the physical sense; it was his mind that 
    was caught up. It was caught up into another dimension, to a higher way of 
    understanding the mystery of the Presence of God in the world. The apocryphal 
    Book of Enoch tells us that on the Third Heaven is the Tree of Life. Besides 
    discovering his own exalted place on the World Tree (in the historical scheme 
    of things), Paul's mind was carried into the future, into our times, and to 
    the words: &quot;To them that overcome will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, 
    which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.&quot; (Revelation 2:7). He went 
    on a metaphysical journey into the heavens of human perception.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To discover the meaning of it, 
    we, like Paul, must abandon our old affections, and out literal interpretations, 
    and yield ourselves to the Spirit that is overshadowing our age. Then we might 
    discover that a rapture is indeed happening, and that the Messiahs are indeed 
    being manifest in this holy season of the Seventh Month. </font>M.M. Huntington<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">One could never realize as a dreamy youth (or even as an intense 
  and serious youth as Paul must have been), that they were in pursuit of a Holy 
  Grail (that they were on some pathway of initiation), or even that such a mystery 
  actually existed outside of the movies and picture books, much less than that 
  it was at one time the central object of Christian contemplation, until they 
  began to be awakened to it later in life, or perhaps when they suddenly looked 
  around and found themselves walking the hallways of the Grail Castle itself. 
  (It can happen in an instant, as it did with Paul. But even then, the pathways 
  leading up to such an experience are without doubt life-long, deeply personal 
  and spiritually complex). One religious journal describes it in terms of (suddenly) 
  entering the realm of the Mythosphere. (And one can definetly appear to others 
  as finally and completely self deluded after a visit to this realm, as it was 
  written by so many of Paul). Once inside, if one's thoughts are so oriented, 
  one looks around--again, as Paul did--and finds that the Grail Castle and the 
  <a href="../UsedImages/pg29a.gif">Temple structure</a> (Solomon's Temple), are 
  actually one and the same. The mind sees that these two have been built into 
  one another, out of the same <i>building blocks of enlightenment</i> as the 
  Buddhist teachers call them... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But one could not have planned to visit it. (Those who set 
  out in search of it did not find it, yet many, even without knowing it yet, 
  are already there, wandering around the passageways. It is illusive that way). 
  One can only look backwards in time as they awaken, to see how they got there, 
  and marvel at it all. It is as if doorways (or heavens) began to open in the 
  chambers and hallways of reality, expanding and transforming one's sense of 
  it as it were. One also finds, however, that there are stairways in this Castle, 
  some of them leading upwards, but some of them leading downwards as well. Which 
  is why one must be prepared, completely &quot;unknowingly,&quot; in every normal 
  (sane, non-psychotic) way before they enter. It is no place for those who are 
  paranoid, or who are prone to, or who actually suffer spiritual delusions, particularly 
  messianic ones, because some of these are twisted passageways indeed; they lead 
  not only to the towers but also through the dungeons (of one's own mind that 
  is). One must tread these passageways in a state of grace, and virtually<i> 
  alone</i>. They must also have come to be assured within themselves that if 
  they got trapped somewhere along the way they had but to call out--to the Ones 
  whose House it is, and that they would be rescued; and that they would not be 
  punished for having gone that way and gotten lost. And they must learn that 
  they can also count on those others--of all things, those sisters and brothers 
  that they didn't even know they had--who they find treading these passageways 
  also. And, so assured, <i>believing all things</i> as Paul wrote, that if they 
  should at all encounter that Dragon that they have been told dwells somewhere 
  deep down in the abyss of this Castle, that they have been equipped with all 
  the spiritual weapons that are necessary to overcome it (ones they must have 
  also somehow gathered along the way...Ephesians 6:11-17). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In one's arsenal must also be those full measures of Faith 
  and Courage (as well as Charity, see 1 Corinthians 13), for without these one 
  cannot hope to break the Dragon's power, the fear of him, and the threats and 
  accusations that he breathes, and the condemnations that he conjures up. For 
  fear alone could keep a soul from its own state of self-realization. But if 
  fear turned into disbelief, these together would very definetly keep a soul 
  from accepting the almost unbeliveable truth of its own unfolding revelations 
  and intuitions (see Zechariah 3:1). And to draw back afterwards is worse. The 
  Great Serpent (the chief of all devils--Ravana, the Ten-headed demon in the 
  <i>Ramayana</i>, and Mara to the Buddhists, whom the Buddha defeated by simply 
  applying one finger gently to the ground beneath himself, establishing himself 
  at his own center, at his own holy place of spiritual causation...see Luke 11:20)--would 
  get the ultimate victory. The critical conjunction of the &quot;Three Suns&quot; 
  (or in Paul's case the &quot;Three Moons&quot;) would pass, and there would 
  be no healing, no proper diffusion of the Light, no fulfilling of the scriptures, 
  and no meaning or conclusion to history...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But who can resist God's will? We realize that every soul's 
  path has been laid out by God (understand Romans, chapter 8, even the pathways 
  of Darkness for the children of Darkness). For the children of Light, however, 
  every path, and every passageway, and every experience, leads inwards, through 
  the hallways and chambers of the mind, and eventually to the great central chamber 
  of Reality, to the grand and exquisite and greatly lit Throne Room of the Castle 
  itself. Upon arriving we discover the Divine Mother there, sitting on Her Throne 
  right next to the Heavenly Father. We see that these two, the Masters of Myth 
  and Illusion themselves, are ONE. They have always been ONE. And we realize 
  that it was She (without whom we could have known nothing of the Father), along 
  with Her handmaidens, who was the custodian of the Holy Grail all along; and 
  that it was She who had the Sword Excalibur in Her own possession all this time 
  as well. And that it is She who has preserved these treasures for those who 
  love Her and who have pursued Her into these times (It is Divine Wisdom that 
  we speak of). And finding the Two of them there, Their powers complimenatry 
  of the other (She, the <i>Shekinah</i>, the great Muse of the West now, and 
  He the terrible specter of the Powers of the East), we come to understand what 
  They are now bringing to pass in the Earth--a shift in consciousness from the 
  realm of myth to the sphere of reality, from the Seventh sefira on the Tree 
  of Life to the Eighth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> And we also come to understand how, here at this end of the 
  age--in contrast to the conditions that existed at the beginning of this age, 
  when many of the Essenes (but not all), and even Paul himself, were given to 
  the celibate life--this same journey into the heavens of human comprehension 
  could only have been accomplished in the company and with the help of a Soulmate 
  (where the two are made together in the image of God that is), and in the context 
  of family and children, in the balance between this world and the other, in 
  the restraints of love, and in those heartaches and struggles that purify the 
  soul, in the loving and wonderful confusions of Life itself. (An inquiring heart 
  is the pathway to the Castle, Love is the key, Belief is the chain upon which 
  the key hangs, and only Faith can turn the key). But one also finds, that even 
  after discovering their way to the castle, that they must leave it behind (along 
  with every other strong attatchment to the world beyond, believing, however, 
  that one could never lose those things which are most precious and eternal, 
  but will gain them back again). They must return to those who are laboring in 
  the darkness of this world:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me 
    the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall 
    make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 
    10:8-10; Ezekiel 2:9 to 3:1-3). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Contemplating the oracles (the little book is the key to unlocking 
  them and all their present meanings), inquiring into the ways in which the idea 
  of Messiah (or Messiahs) now attends them in our time...</font></p>

  <p align="center"><b>The West</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...one will have also found themself thinking back and forth 
  along those lines on the Oracle which lead from the time of Aaron and Moses 
  into the first centuries of this age (the time of John the Baptist and Paul), 
  and finally into the mystery of our own times, and, as we have already alluded, 
  into the meaning of Paul's doctrine concerning the state of marriage at 1 Corinthians 
  7; for, as we shall come to see, Paul knew that every perfected soul would eventually 
  be united with its own soulmate in the fulness of time, either in this world 
  or the world to come. With Paul, <i>the Little One</i>, it would happen in this 
  world, and in <i>this</i> present lifetime as it is written: <i>The kingdom 
  of heaven is like unto a great king who made a marriage for his son</i>. (Matthew 
  22:1-3; Joel 2:15,16). Paul is this son. (Galatians 1:15,16). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the journey to understand these things one might have also 
  found themself one day staring from the tip of Manhatten Island, out across 
  New York Harbor, perhaps at the (then) silent profile of Ellis Island. They 
  might have begun to experience the Mist (the Oceanic Spirit), and suddenly have 
  felt the very history of Western civilization itself lapping at the concrete 
  shore beneath their feet. With a terrible feeling of insignificance...and yet, 
  somehow feeling very connected to it all, one might in a moment of time have 
  sensed the whole of Divine reality unfolding before their very eyes. One might 
  have also, in such a moment of elevation, sensed the intricate meaning, not 
  only of every human event but of every spoken word, of every written word, of 
  every song, of every poem (perhaps the meaning of poetry itself--does it not, 
  along with all the other heavenly disciplines, open up the consciousness and 
  say to the soul what other forms of words cannot?):</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The country was inundated 
    with cross-currents of Judaisms in strife with one another. Intermingled with 
    the stern morality of Judaism were foreign currents--the Zoroastrian resurrection 
    beliefs, pagan fertility rites, Adonis and Osiris dying-son cults, Oriental 
    mysticism, a hodgpodge of beliefs. In Christianity all these inchoate yearnings, 
    all these dissident opinions, found a unification. Christianity took the best 
    of these resurrection cults, dying-son beliefs, mysticism, myths, rites, and 
    it forged them into a new, lofty religion of redemption for man and promise 
    of heaven.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the same way, the new religion 
    of Hasidism grew out of similar soil--political oppression, social unrest, 
    Sabbatean messiah worship, Frankist sex rites, mystic cults, revelation, penance. 
    Hasidism transcended all this in the way Christianity had transcended the 
    Oriental religious cults. Hasidism forged all the yearnings of the people 
    into a new stream of Judaism, sloughing off the obscene, the gross, the sexual 
    in Sabbateanism and Frankism, leaving only the essence of a new religious 
    movement which tried to exalt the spirit. But just as Christianity in its 
    early forms was <i>unrealistic</i> in its attitude toward the state </font>(the 
    author says)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, so early Hasidism 
    was unrealistic in its attitude toward the dual role man has to play on earth--his 
    role in relation to state, and his role in relation to God.</font><b> </b>(Both 
    early Christianity and early Hasidism were walking in the ways of the same 
    Spirit, in the expressed precepts of the Law and the Prophets as they were 
    being revealed in their individual times by the Spirit..see Matthew 5:17-20)<b>.</b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hasidism was not a simple thing; 
    it was a complex syndrome. It was the triumph of ignorance over knowledge. 
    The Talmud said that no ignorant man could be pious. Hasidism preached the 
    reverse. It affirmed the Jewish spirit without the Jewish tradition. It created 
    its own tradition by proclaiming itself more Jewish than Jewishness itself. 
    Hasidism was strength through joy, an affirmation of the ecstatic, not the 
    ecstasy of the senses as with the Frankists but with the ecstasy of knowing 
    God. In one fell swoop, Bal Shem Tov turned weakness into strength, defeat 
    into triumph. Just as Jesus had opposed the Pharisee intellectuals, so Bal 
    Shem Tov opposed the Talmudic intellectuals. Hasidism and early Christianity 
    were kindred spirits.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Israel ben Eliezer, known by his 
    disciples as Bal Shem Tov (Master of the Good Name), the founder of Hasidism, 
    was born about 1700 in a region of the Ukraine </font>(Edom)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    His life, as outlined by his disciples, remarkably paralleled that of Jesus. 
    An angel appeared to Bal Shem Tov's parents, when they were at an advanced 
    age. God, said the angel, was going to bless them with a son in their old 
    age, even as He had blessed Abraham and Sarah, and this son would carry the 
    message of the Lord to man on earth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bal Shem Tov's parents, who conceived 
    him late in their lives, died early in his. When he was six years old, the 
    elders of the community, as required by the Talmud, gave him a free education. 
    His early manhood was spent in the wilderness, in utter poverty, performing 
    miracles which his disciples speak of with wonder even today, such as healing 
    the sick by touching him, walking across deep water, causing a tree to burn 
    just by looking at it, banishing a ghost by uttering the secret 'Name.' Once 
    he intervened with the populace of a town which had turned against a prostitute. 
    Bal Shem Tov touched her, whereupon she became whole and saintly. He had direct 
    intercession with God in heaven. One word from him could release a tortured 
    soul from hell. Wherever he went a radiance hovered over him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the account of his disciples. 
    Others are less kind. One dissenting school holds that Bal Shem Tov was lazy 
    and stupid, an irresponsible failure who succeeded in nothing he undertook, 
    who was fired from every job he ever held. His disciples, again, aver that 
    actually Bal Shem Tov slept days because he secretly studied nights, that 
    he deliberately created an impression as a ne'er-do-well until God revealed 
    the time for him to announce who he really was. This Bal Shem Tov did at age 
    forty-two.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bal Shem Tov wrote (almost) nothing, 
    and we are dependent upon his disciples for what he did say. Most of it is 
    preserved, as in the case with Jesus, in allegories and parables. When Bal 
    Shem Tov died in 1760, he had about 100,000 adherents. At its high point Hasidism 
    may have embraced half the Jews of Eastern Europe.&quot; </font>(I believe

    the venality of the Jerusalmitan priests. They were swept also by other winds. 
    One of these was a widespread and well-attested contemporary belief that a 
    great cycle of the ages was about to complete its revolution. This belief 
    was based on a conception, which can in fact be traced to remote Indian antiquity, 
    that existence consists not in linear progressive development--that is, in 
    history--but in a constant cyclic repetition of primordial and archetypal 
    events. When major upheavels occurred, it was promptly supposed that the cycle 
    was nearing its end, that the Great Year was at hand, and that cosmos was 
    about to revert to chaos. The primal elements, restrained and regulated at 
    the beginning of the world, would again be unleashed; all things would dissolve

    and understanding'--the result, he intimates, 'of the vision I have seen.'...</font></p>

    that is Master of the Name, because he knew the secret, full name of God, 
    and could say it in such a way that--with its help--he was able to effect 
    strange things and especially to heal men body and soul. When this man knew 
    he was about to die, he did not know to whom to leave the age-old writings

    of Paradise, like cherubim, always found together either under or upon the 
    branches of the Tree of Life)<b>, </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and 
    he will first be revealed in Upper Galilee. Some believed that the soul of 
    the Messiah had not suffered transmigration, but was 'new,' while others contended 
    that it was the soul of Adam which had previously transmigrated to King David. 
    The letters of Adam (alef, dalet, mem) refer to Adam, David, and the Messiah--a 
    'notarikon' found from the end of the 13th century. There is possibly some 
    Christian influence here because, according to Paul, Adam, the first man, 
    corresponds to Jesus, 'the last man' (Rom.5:17). Descriptions of redemption 
    in the Zohar follow in the footsteps of the Midrashim with the addition of 
    some points and certain changes in theme. The redemption will be a miracle, 
    and all that accompanies it miraculous (the stars sparkling and falling, the 
    wars of the end time, the fall of the Pope, who is called symbolically in 
    the Zohar 'the priest of On'). The idea of the pangs of redemption is greatly 
    stressed, and the condition of Israel on the eve of redemption is pictured 
    in terms which reflect the historical conditions of the 13th century...However, 
    in the later Kabbalah (of Moses Cordovero and Isaac Luria) such ideas declined. 
    On the other hand, the mystical basis of redemption was emphasized--the basis 
    that developed from the time of Nahmanides and his school which centered on 
    the midrashic view that redemption would be a return to that perfection which 
    was sullied by the sin of Adam and Eve. It would not be something entirely 
    new, but a restoration, or a renewal. Creation at the time of redemption would 
    assume the form that was intended from the beginning by the Divine Mind. Only 
    at the redemption there would be a revelation of the original nature of Creation 
    which has become obscured or impaired in this world.&quot; </font>Kabbalah,

  Islam will also produce its own spiritual Remnant, its own branch of spiritual 
  adepts, all of whom will merge together in the last day--for they will all see

  along with Judaism and Christianity, must come to its fulfillment here in the 
  West as well. Also see that not only is the Dark side of Islam in the East a 
  reflection of the Dark side of Christianity in the West, but also how the literal 
  elements, the language and the tenor of the Qur'an, which God has employed as 
  a spur to rile up the natural, worldly, as well as the darkened hearts of the 
  sons of Darkness in the East, are literally a judgment against Islam itself. 
  The Qur'an is to Islam, as the Law and the Prophets are to Judaeo-Christianity

<p><font size="+1">We arrive now at a different kind of pre-historical period, 
  not one in which we can find no written accounts (the age is full of written 
  accounts), but one in which much of what was written was also mixed and colored 
  by the religious imagination. This does not mean that these accounts do not 
  reflect a certain kind of reality, or that they were not historically true (for 
  the truth of things by this time had already committed itself to an <i>aoggadic</i> 
  realm, the realm that would become for us in our time the stuff of myths and 
  legends). But because the authors of these works had a license to reach up into 
  the spiritual realm to add what was apocryphal or supernatural to their own 
  historical narratives, we must not read these narratives, or dismiss them, or 
  hold them to the same criteria as we would historical works closer to our own 
  time. We must read them with the same vivid imagination with which they were 
  written; being aware, of course, that the further in time such extra-canonical 
  works are from the source of the Mystery they relate, the more prone they are 
  to personal deduction and speculation, interpolation, and religious bias. Which 
  does not mean the Divine Spirit was not abroad in the land, inspiring those 
  times. She can still be found. It was Her mysteries, however, that were in occultation. 
  These She was withholding from the children of Darkness. The truly religious 
  were living by Faith now, not<i> </i>by<i> Daat, </i>or direct Gnosis (Knowledge).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is also not to say that there were not works of an (almost, 
  somewhat), purely historical character to be found in these times. The writings 
  of the Ante and Post Nicean Church Fathers are to be found (as well as those 
  of the Greek and Roman historians, Herodotus, Polybius, Strabo, Tacitus, Pliney, 
  Cassius Dio among them, and the invaluable works of Philo and Josephus). And 
  there are the vast energies expended in the compilation of the <i>mishnayot</i>, 
  and the eventual formation of the &quot;Talmud(s)&quot; by the <i>Tannaim, Amoraim, 
  </i>and<i> Savoraim </i>of those early centuries. And though these works are 
  invariably doctrinal and organizational, and full of commentaries of one kind 
  of another on some set of religious precepts or another, or a refutation of 
  others, the same rule applies. Those Apostolic Fathers who were in the company 
  of the apostles themselves were almost certainly initiates to the Mystery, and 
  a party to the even greater conspiracy to keep it sealed from the world at large...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Highest gave understanding unto the Five men, and

<p><font size="+1"> From that time on, however, there was an almost complete spiritual 
  blackout, for it is clear that those who came shortly after them were not initiated--perhaps 
  into the fact that there &quot;was a mystery,&quot; but not into the Mystery 
  itself. Eusubius reveals it plainly in his near adoration of Constantine, as 
  do the other Church Fathers in their various non-mystical and non-kabbalistic 
  ways--speaking harshly of things from those times on that they no longer knew, 
  or understood. These latter--whose growing concern was organization and political 
  order, and no longer the freedom of thought necessary to the attainment of personal 
  insight (laboring in the vineyards of Caesar as they were by then)--had sacrificed 
  any chance of seeing into the hidden structure of the written works they were 
  inheriting from the first century. Nor would they allow themselves into the 
  fellowship of those Gnostic sects (those &quot;California cults&quot; as Thomas 
  Cahill described them in <i>How the Irish Saved Civilization</i>), who at least 
  knew there was a hidden structure to these writings, even if they could not 
  piece it all together themselves, and that a certain freedom of thought was 
  the necessary key to it all. In the interest of order they (the orthodox) instead 
  drove out of the life of the &quot;church&quot; every freethinking individual, 
  merkabah mystic, priestly order, or gnostic sect that was not in accordance 
  with their emerging, worldly dictates. This of course eventually led to all 
  the schisms and disorders that have characterized the history of the Church 
  in general, the relationship between the Roman and Eastern churches, and which 
  still defines the Christian religion today. (Poor Pope John-Paul is oblivious 
  to it all, as are all the pompous clerics of the Eastern world. Each believes 
  that their doctrines and their historically divided-churches are still relevant 
  to the continuing life and to the ultimate purpose of Christianity in the world).

  forced marches, Orthodox Judaism as an institution has by and large accompanied 
  no armies, and has overswept no lands in the Name of God (not until the 20th 
  century that is). It has sentenced none to the gallows or the flames (not until 
  the 20th century that is), but has rather throughout the centuries been a victim 
  of these things itself. No wonder it despises the name of Jesus. The Talmud 
  (in which this obscure &quot;Jeschu&quot; is defamed in every unknowing and 
  apocryphal way as a result), brought to its present forms from the fifth to 
  tenth centuries, was a collective effort in self preservation--not only from 
  those into whose hands the Law and the Prophets had &quot;fallen&quot; (the 
  Essenes ostensibly among them because of their Gnostic and Buddhist tendencies), 
  but from what Christianity was rapidly becoming after the mysteries were sealed. 
  The Talmud is also the result of a commandment that was passed along <a href="../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif">that 
  line on the Tree of Life</a> that leads from Binah (the time of Moses) to Din, 
  or Geburah (the time of Christ), to Hod (in our time), instructing those Jews

  question we will ask, however, is from where did this commandment come? (From 
  above of course. For unbeknown to it, the Lord of History was setting this branch 
  of Judaism aside, as &quot;Keepers,&quot; <i>Shamerim</i>, of the jot and tittle

    200 A.D. by Judah ha-Nasi (the Prince), the head of the Sanhedrin ( a great

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second division of the Talmud

    resulted in the Gemara took place in the great academies of Palestine and 
    Babylonia from the second to the fifth centuries...The legal parts of the

    brilliant--and dreary; insightful-and trivial; awesome-and maddeningly obscure...Sophistry

    numerology, and quaint nonsense: wrestlings with the Devil and his Demons, 
    revelations from shining angels and celestial messengers, mystical miasmas

    For over the sprawling terrain of the Talmud disagreements rage, views clash, 
    arguments are marshaled, advanced, withdrawn...Rabbinical law is very far 
    from being unitary or consistent; opposing views--even rancorous--disagreements

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the answer lies for the moment in the realization that 
  the idea of placing a Fence around the Law was already present with the Essenes, 
  before the time of Christ and long before the Rabbis began to fully implement 
  it with <i>Mishna </i>and <i>Gemareh </i>in the second century<i>.</i> As we 
  pursue the true identity of Paul we will also be exploring the means by which 
  the commandment to build this Fence came over to the Pharisees from the Essene 
  side of the Tree. We shall see how it was to facilitate the very structure, 
  and the historical dimensions of the Tree of Life itself. The Talmud as such 
  (which grew out of those times to constitute the Oral Law for Jews), is, as 
  is told above, comprised of a complex compilation of orthodox opinions and responses 
  to that earlier 2nd and 3rd century collection of materials, which in turn was 
  gathered out of those more obscure corners of the preceding three centuries. 
  The <i>Mishna</i> as this first collection or codification is known was gathered 
  a text here and a text there, a recollection here and a recollection there. 
  It is accredited to Rabbi Judah, Yahuda Hanassi, during the closing years of 
  the second century, but the initial compilation is, again, accredited to Rabbi 
  Akiba...but not exclusively:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The great rabbis of the Talmudic 
    era were generally identified by their individual names prefaced by the title 
    &quot;Rabbi.&quot; Only one was simply called &quot;Rabbi&quot;...with no 
    need to indicate his specific name. All knew that when one referred to &quot;Rabbi&quot; 
    or &quot;Rebbe&quot; the intention was Rabbi Yahuda Hanassi. The expression 
    of affection was due to his personal greatness as well as his outstanding 
    service to the community...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Probably the greatest accomplishment 
    of Rabbi Yahuda Hanassi was his compilation of the Mishna. This too was for 
    the benefit of 'mankind.' He saw that times had changed and it became necessary 
    to have a central written code for all Jews. WHAT EARLIER GENERATIONS COULD 
    RECORD IN THEIR MEMORY WAS BECOMING FORGOTTEN...Rabbi Yahuda was a leader 
    recognized by all and was thus able to formulate a text of the Oral Law that 
    would be acceptable to all.&quot; </font>Rabbi Zushe Winner, the Jewish Press<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Excelling all others in this

    he systematized Midrash (halakhah), halahkot, (mishnayot), and aggadot. (TJ. 
    Shek 5:1, 48c). Judah Ha-Nasi said, 'To whom can R. Akiva be compared? To

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another saying by Akiba, though 
    with nothing except the sequence (in the Sayings of the Fathers) to show that 
    he was its author. It is a declaration concerning divine foreknowledge and 
    human free will. It attempts no solution of the contradiction between these, 
    but affirms both and rests in the assurance that He who judges is good. Judgment 
    takes account of what man has done. Into these few lines Akiba compressed 
    well nigh the whole Rabbinic philosophy of religion. Perhaps philosophy of 
    religion is hardly the right term, FOR THE RABBIS OF THE TALMUDIC PERIOD WERE 
    NOT EXPONANTS OF PHILOSOPHY. </font>(The earliest of Christians were)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    But these words of Akiba give the Rabbinic answer to one of the great problems 
    of the philosophy of religion; and the answer has never been challenged as 
    the expression of the fundamental Jewish conviction, that divine foreknowledge 
    and human freedom were equally real and true, though human wisdom could not 
    intellectually reconcile them.</font><b> </b>(It is one of the quantum paradoxes 
    of which the universe is created. Compare to Romans 8:28-39, and to the reality 
    of all the events of the 20th century). Akiba spoke for the practical needs 
    of the religious and ethical consciousness of man, NOT for the theoretical 
    satisfaction of the inquiring mind. In like manner he affirmed, what Judaism 
    has never challenged, THAT THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DIVINE JUDGMENT IS GOODNESS; 
    whether judgment be, or, according to some, be not, according to the amount 
    of work. Akiba here laid bare the 'solid rock' on which the whole structure

    into their 'mishnayot' some collections of the teachings of other 'tannaim,' 
    even citing their words anonymously. R. Judah did this WITH THE MISHNA OF 
    R.ELIEZER (Zev.3:6; see Tosef., ibid. 2:17). R. Yose, who received the tradition 
    from Johannan b. Nuri (Ket. 1:10; Tosef., Shev. 4:13; Meg. 2:4) and was the 
    pupil of R. Halafta, disagreed with R. Akiva...Our Mishna embodies also collections

  point to be made here is that not every <i>mishnayot</i> passed through the

  by way of a certain R. Eliezer, who was himself excommunicated. For what? For 
  his fellowship with the &quot;heritics&quot; (those Essenes who formed the early 
  Jewish Church, and very likely with the person, or rather, with the knowledge 
  of the hidden doctrines of Elisha ben Abuyah [Paul] himself). And as such neither 
  Rabbi Judah, or those who grew up after that time on Talmud-Torah could have 
  suspected that these <i>mishnayot</i> and traditions which came over to them 
  via Eliezer (or in the name of Eliezer), actually originated with those <i>Merkabah</i> 
  mystics--those earliest of <i>Christian</i>-Essenes--who were themselves still 
  part of the Right Hand-Jewish tradition on the Tree of Life. They would not 
  have been aware that these teachings, these very guarded <i>mishnayot</i> came 
  over to them from the other side of the Tree, the side of Levi, where (the original)

  go as far to conceal these things as they do to reveal them). What we may surmise 
  is that these names and many of the kabbalistic doctrines of the early Church 
  passed over into Judaism, and were eventually associated with certain other

    'God-fearers,' they must have told him in his youth about the famous Pharisees 
    of Judaea, who occupied the apex of Jewish religious learning and piety, and 
    were almost legendary figures to the Jews and God-fearers of the Diaspora. 
    The young Saul would have heard the names of the greatest Pharisee leaders, 
    Hillel, Shammai and Gamaliel. Perhaps even in Tarsus (Tarshish), he may have 
    seen one or two of the noted Pharisee figures of his day, for many of the 
    sages were travellers, who briefly visited Jewish communities in both the 
    Roman and Parthian empires, in order to preach and deliver messages from the

<p><font size="+1">The fact is that no one knows anything of these sages--who

  down about them; or of this period in history other than what we can surmise 
  from other sources. And neither has history wondered aloud about Paul's real 
  identity, nor has it asked much about this place called Tarsus, or rather Tarshish, 
  from which we are told he came. Paul himself provides the clue when he says: 
  <i>I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia</i> (Acts 
  21:39,40), which does not mean that he is from anywhere in the East at all.

<p><font size="+1">Josephus, who is the primary source of our understanding of 
  those times, is, as we shall come to see, also an initiate into these higher 
  mysteries and is also hiding as much in his narratives of those times as he 
  reveals. The whole period is be-clouded in the Divine Mist if you will (see 
  Chapter 4). And further study will continue to reveal how this <i>Cloud</i> 
  gradually descended out of Europe eastward--over those centuries leading up 
  to the time of Alexander, and continued to descend during the tumultuous events 
  of the Maccabean period--before it ascended back up into Europe again in the 
  mystery of Christ. (Please <a href="SideLinks/NotesFromEurope.htm">follow this

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;According to Jewish tradition, 
    Ezra founded the...Great Assembly, a synod of teachers who received the corpus 
    of doctrine which had been preserved to their day, adapted and developed it 
    to suit the new conditions of their age, and then transmitted it to the pioneers 
    of the Talmudic Rabbis. The chain of authority is thus described: 'Moses received 
    the Torah on Sinai, and handed it down to JOSHUA; Joshua to the Elders; the 
    Elders to the Prophets; and the Prophets handed it down to the men of the 
    Great Assembly.' (Aboth 1.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The existence of such a Synod has 
    been questioned by modern scholars.</font><b> </b>(And this because there 
    is no trace of its existence whatsoever in Palestine. It didn't assemble there--not 
    before the time of Christianity)<b>. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
    it must be admitted that the two and a half centuries which followed the career 
    of Ezra are wrapped in obscurity and practically no historical data are available, 
    yet there seems no sound reason to doubt that an official body of teachers 
    must have functioned during that period. A far-seeing reformer like Ezra could 
    not have failed to realize that his work would inevitably fall to pieces soon 
    after his death unless he was succeeded by men who, imbued with his own zeal, 
    would continue his policy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the veil of ignorance lifts 
    we find ourselves in the early part of the second century B.C. witnessing 
    a heroic struggle on the part of a small band of Jews to resist an attempt 
    to destroy their religion. The Hasmoneans pitted themselves against the armies 
    of Syria because Antiochus dared to order them to violate the precepts of 
    Judaism, 'to the end they might forget the Torah and change all the ordinances' 
    (1 Macc.i.49). Mattathias, on raising the standard of revolt, proclaimed: 
    'Whoever is zealous for the Torah, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow 
    me' (ibid. ii.27); and before his death he exorted his sons: 'Be valient and

<p><font size="+1">We have seen in the Addendum chapter entitled &quot;Notes From

  groups of Celts and Thracians (Jews), who had--according to all the implications 
  of his histories and the Books of the Maccabees--extended their affairs out 
  of Europe into lower Syria and Palestine (over the entire region from the Hellespont

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And from this we also reason that these <i>now-Asian</i>-Celts 
  were drawn into these events, not only as a result of the overarching ambitions 
  of the Selucid kings, but of the wars in general that were being waged between 
  the Selucids and the Ptolemies. We learned that these wars were not only fought 
  overland between the present regions of Syria and Egypt (which is where history 
  erroneously places the totality of these Maccabean wars), but across the Hellespont, 
  and by sea, between Egypt and the mainland of Europe as well. These wars encompassed 
  a Jewish population that was spread across the whole Eastern world at that time, 
  from Europe to Asia Minor, to Egypt. Just because other historians did not classify 
  these European peoples as Jews, it does not mean that certain Jewish or Hebrew 
  scribes, who had a broader view of history, could not--which they did. We can 
  also readily identify some of those Celts who spilled out of Europe with the 
  Galatians, to whom Paul addressed his Epistle. And though his ministry was primarily 
  to the Gentiles, he clearly addresses these Galatians as if they were Jews, 
  and writes to them, not only of Jewish matters (of Hebrew allegories and archetypes), 
  but of things that will ultimately concern the Jewish people in our time--those 
  Zionists who also spilled out of Europe to the East again in these last days--again 
  in the literal spirit of the Maccabees. (Galatians, chapter 5). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We have also learned that the place-names and geographical 
  locations referred to by the authors of our Hebrew texts were not always the 
  places we think they were referring to, for many place-names in those ancient 
  times were carried from an original place to some other place, or had a broader 
  meaning than we are presently aware of. The word, or the place named <i>Cyprus</i> 
  for instance. Josephus says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Of the three sons of Javan 
    also, the son of Japhet, Elisa gave name to the Eliseans, who were his subjects; 
    they are now the Aeolians. Tharsus to the Tharsians: for so was Cilicia of 
    old called; the sign of which is this, that the noblest city they have, and 
    a metropolis also, is Tarsus, the &quot;tau&quot; being by change put for 
    the &quot;theta.&quot; Cethimus possessed the island of Cethima; it is now 
    called Cyprus: AND FROM IT IS THAT ALL ISLANDS, AND THE GREATER PART OF THE 
    SEA-COASTS ARE NAMED CHETHIM BY THE HEBREWS...&quot; </font>Antiquities of 
    the Jews, Book I.VI.I<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(Now understand the Habukkuk Commentary in the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
  It is referring to America in the last days). Thus the point we are striving 
  at here is that just as these things formed the hidden backdrop against which 
  the religious books and historical documents of those times were written, they 
  also formed the backdrop and the conditions under which the precepts of the 
  Mishna were secretly transmitted. <i>Confusion, </i>as it is said in the Book 
  of Daniel,<i> as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of 
  Jerusalem, and unto all Israel that are far or near...</i>(Daniel 9:4-8; Baruch, 
  chapter 2).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Many things transpired in history between the time of Ezra 
  and the formulation of the <i>Mishna </i>over five-hundred years later. The 
  commandment to set a hedge or a fence around the Written Torah was also received 
  in reaction to the interdictions and the persecutions certain pious Jews and 
  Samaritans later suffered at the hands of the Hasmoneans after they came to 
  power in the East, who said they were champions of the Torah but were not. But 
  almost certainly--according to the already-quoted Zadokite Document--from that 
  same fellowship of <i>Merkabah</i> mystics, who not only had insight to the 
  <i>wondrous mysteries</i>, and to the dimensions of the Oracle with its two 
  distinct sides (Levi and Judah), but who also &quot;knew the place.&quot; These 
  Jewish mystics were also preparing to pass into occultation (to get inside that 
  fence themselves--with Judaism itself), again, according to the dictates of 
  the Oracle (according to the hidden ordinances of the Moon), as the very sublime 
  but-also-concealed doctrines of Paul were left to accompany the course of the 
  Sun of Righteousness (Christianity), in its rise to power in the Western world. 
  (Understand Malachi, chapter 4, KJV). And just as Christianity grew up with 
  no clear idea of the meaning or the source of the traditions that were passed 
  to it, so it is plain to see that the same is true for Judaism. It was a great 
  conspiracy:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">By the time the Mishna is sealed and the Talmud is composed, 
  and the secret oral and written traditions are passed from one generation to 
  the next, this Rabbi Schimeon, who appears everywhere in the pages of the Zohar, 
  will become a certain Rabbi Schimeon who was said to be a later disciple of 
  Rabbi Akiba. The doctrines and the sayings attributed to that rabbi, however, 
  could only have come from, or through someone who was closely allied to those 
  whose energies were also going into the formulation of the Christian mysteries. 
  And as such we must conclude that these excerpts from the Zohar are, again, 
  gleened from the traditions that passed into Judaism by way of the likes of 
  Rabbi Eliezer and others, who perhaps received the teachings from Simon Peter 
  directly. We conclude that this Rabbi Schimeon of Talmudic fame passed the doctrines 
  along in the name of a prior Rabbi Simeon, who unbeknown to all was none other 
  than that Rabbi Simon (bar Jonah) of Christian fame, whose ministry was, again, 
  almost explicitly to &quot;the Circumcision.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let us say something of Rabbi Akiba here. And let us say it 
  with the utmost respect for the history of Judaism (it has come to the very 
  conclusion in the world as G-d has decreed), and for the experiences of the 
  Jewish people throughout the centuries, and most particularly here in the 20th 
  century. (These things too have been ordained by the Master of the Universe, 
  despite the intellectual and academic rantings of others to the contrary). It 
  has been said that R. Akiba was a master of the Kabbalah. He was also a strident 
  Jewish nationalist. Thus either one knows the mystery or they do not. Rabbi 
  Akiba did not. (Please see Romans 10). The stories related to him in the Talmud, 
  and of all of the <i>Tannaim</i> of that period, reflect and are colored by 
  the entire range of disagreements and antagonisms that characterized the period, 
  from the time of Christ right up to the final split between Christianity and 
  Judaism. They will even reflect the early strife that existed between Peter 
  (Simeon) and Paul (Elisha ben Abuyah), which was settled in the secret councils 
  of the early Church, and of which Peter will later say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, 
    be diligent that ye might be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; 
    even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him 
    hath written unto you;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">As also in his epistles, speaking in them of these things; 
    in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned 
    and unstable wrest, as they do all other scriptures to their own destruction...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Peter 3:14-16).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Why were these things also settled in secret? Because the secret 
  was too great, and because Paul himself could not openly reveal what he understood 
  of it either. That is, as we shall see, he could not reveal his own understanding 
  of his position in the greater spiritual scheme of things, his understanding 
  of his own place on the Tree of Life. To do so would be to reveal the heights 
  and depths of the Mystery of Christ itself--which was being intentionally concealed. 
  He had to speak cryptically to those without, which opened him up to the severest 
  attacks by others; and only with the fullest measure of revelation to those 
  within his own inner circle--a circle which will later include the Apostles 
  themselves and the later authors of the Gospels. (Please understand 2 Kings 
  2:15). These things filtered into the thinking of the Pharisees according to 
  the measure in which they were either willing, or made to receive them. Paul 
  speaks of this initial strife between himself and the others, and then of the 
  eventual arrangement between himself and Simon Peter when he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But of these who seemed somewhat (whatsoever they were, 
    it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person) for they who seemed 
    to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the 
    uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was 
    to Peter;</font></i></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Those on the side of the Circumcision wanted to keep their 
  concept of the Christ Mystery tight, in a more or less strict context of the 
  written Law, for fear that the written Law itself would become over the course 
  of time obscured in its own broader meanings. And when those meanings were spread 
  out so thin upon the earth, as they are today, that they lost their effects 
  on the life of Israel (especially in the great Falling Away which brought us 
  to the founding of the American nation and to all of the events of the 20th 
  century), there would be nothing to return to. There would be no contrast, nothing 
  to re-excite in us the necessary tensions that exist between the Written and 
  the Oral traditions, thus between the hidden, inner, or higher world of principles 
  and ideas and the outer world of material forms and literal interpretations. 
  We would forget that the emerging corpus of New Testament writings would still 
  require interpretation in terms of the original Written Law, that the one required 
  the other. Thus the Judaic side of the early Church took its teachings with 
  it into the religious underground, and to preserve them against the last days 
  committed them to the Rabbis...who in turn must have been led to understand 
  that they were receiving a Tradition that was being absolutely concealed from 
  the Gentiles (which it was, as fully agreed upon by Paul and the Apostles), 
  even from those who were soon to form the outer structure of the Christian religion 
  as we know it today.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the other hand it was necessary that Paul's school assimilate 
  the ideas and philosophies of the Gentile world--the Gnostic traditions and 
  the mystery religions--for the very reason that they derived from the ancient 
  Hebrew tradition to begin with. And for the added reason, that many of these 
  so-called <i>Gentiles</i> were actually remnants of the seed of the children 
  of Israel, some who had fallen away over the course of earlier centuries, and 
  some who were very devout in their own understanding. It was the correct course, 
  even though it became a great source of spiritual energy for the sons of Darkness 
  to feed upon. But out of great Darkness proceeds great Light, the greater the 
  one the greater the other. Millions in the Western world are now waiting for 
  the next revelation, and the signs of Messiah. Judaism by itself, it is plain 
  to see, could not have accomplished it. (It was inside the hedge).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What was it that Paul brought to the fellowship in Jerusalem? 
  And what was it that initially set him apart from them as a result--the Bone 
  of Contention as it was? In answering let us ask, what was the essential difference 
  between John's Gospel and Paul's (Acts 18:23-28; 19:1-5)? And then let us realize, 
  first, that the Book of Acts and the Gospel narratives did not appear until 
  over forty years or more after Paul's epistles were disemminated throughout 
  the early Church, and after his doctrines were finally understood and agreed 
  upon by the Fellowship; and then secondly, that the Gospels themselves (which 
  we shall come to see include the figure of Paul himself), are not an account 
  of things that actually happened before the arrival of Paul on the scene, but 
  are largely the literary result of Paul's Gospel itself (see Romans 2:16). They 
  will reflect, not only what Paul learned from the Nazarites, or the Jewish Essenes) 
  (the higher implications of the Name, YHShVH), but what they also learned from 
  him (the corresponding implications of the name, Jesus. Please see chapter 6 
  and 7). To all of the texts and commentaries on the Qumran scrolls now in print 
  (<i>The Dead Sea Scriptures </i>by Theodore Gaster, and <i>The Dead Sea Scrolls 
  Uncovered </i>by Eisenman and Wise are excellent works on the subject), and 
  to all of the Kabbalistic traditions that passed into mainstream Judaism, thus 
  to all of the epic and apocalyptic visions of the Essene community, which were 
  by and large the extent of the doctrines of the early Jewish church, add the 
  Vedic and Druid mystery of <i>Christ Crucified</i>: </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul did not learn these things from Peter or the other disciples 
  of John the Baptist, but rather taught these things to them. The disciples of 
  John knew the place (the City of DaViD in the Center of Europe). They had already 
  returned to it before the execution of Stephen. They perceived the Divine Form--the 
  overshadowing presence of the Metatron, the Lord of hosts who dwells in the 
  sum of every natural and human event; thus the allegorical and epic relationship 
  between the archetypal figure of Joshua, the captain of the armies of Israel 
  (Joshua 5:13-15), and the God of Battle and War--the Great One of the Sun and 
  the Consuming Fire. (Isaiah 66:15-18). And though they were already wearing 
  the white robes of the Essene order, they seemed by all accounts not to have 
  completely understood, or rather, to have concerned themselves as yet with certain 
  doctrines of the Vedas, or of the Druids who dwelt on the other side of the 
  mountains from Eastern and Central Europe, and how these doctrines related to 
  the Torah. Or at least they placed no great emphasis on them. (The fact that 
  these doctrines of the Crucified Christ were being emphasized after the advent 
  of Paul is, of course, reflected later in the Gospel narratives, all of which 
  were composed entirely after the facts, and after the meeting of the minds). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus, until Paul, the Essenes were failing to take into account 
  that the terrible Indra (the YHVH of the Hebrews, into whose Name John was baptising 
  those who came to him, John 1:1-14), had revealed himself to the ancient adepts 
  in the form of the Suffering (wholly pacifistic and wholly non-violent) Sacrifice, 
  the Lamb of God suspended on the limbs of the Cosmic World Tree. Not simply 
  the Suffering Servant of the Hebrew Prophets, however, which was also a metaphor 
  for the entire holy nation, but the cursed Hesus of the Druid Oak, upon whom 
  heaven had not only laid the sins of the world but who also, as Paul discovered, 
  guarded the Doorway to the world beyond. In this Hesus or Jesus (another distinct 
  manifestation of the YHShVH of the Law and the Prophets, the Divine aspect in 
  every soul), and in the corresponding dimensions of the Universal Cross, Paul 
  discovered the unifying and central figure in the entire world-mystery system, 
  the very apotheosis of the universe itself. Indeed, he found in this aspect 
  of the Christ-mystery every hidden meaning of the Law and the Prophets, and 
  thus the very source of all his troubles with the Jews--the means by which the 
  religion of Israel is reconciled to every other religion on earth. (But this 
  was not the whole <i>crux</i> of Paul's difficulties. He found even more than 
  this as we shall shortly come to see):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It was written of Simon Magus, the general archetypal figure 
  of all ecclesiastical heresy (with whom Paul has also been compared), that he 
  was influenced by the teachings of John the Baptist. He was part of John's outer 
  circle. Yet we learn from the writings of Clement that he came to consider himself 
  &quot;the Standing One,&quot; &quot;that power of God which is known as the 
  Great Power,&quot; of his generation. How is it that he didn't know any better, 
  especially since it was later written in the Gospels that Jesus himself came 
  to be baptized by John in the Jordan? The only way to explain it lies in the 
  fact that neither was this Simon initiated into the inner mystery, even though 
  he thought he was. And not only that, but in his own delusions he came to think 
  that he was possibly the focus of it all. Yet he must have been initiated just 
  enough to know that where it said that Jesus came to be baptized of John it 
  secretly meant in the collective Body of every soul who came to him during his 
  secret rites of purification. This left Simon Magus with ample space to consider 
  himself the actual Anointed One of his times, the one who was to follow the 
  Baptist and stand along side of him on the Right side of the Tree of Life. He 
  became the one instead with whom Simon Peter had to contend from one end of 
  the empire to the other.</font></p>

    goal of the entire spiritual adventure; the aim of the Torah and of the disciplined 
    life which it enjoins. They hold that by virtue of their 'enlightenment' they 
    are members not only of a consecrated earthly brotherhood but...also of the 
    Eternal Communion. As one of their psalmists puts it, they walk forever 'in

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus (the mystery of YHWShWH), the Jehoshua of John the Baptist, 
  was appearing in the persons of those who were being initiated into the overspreading 
  mystery itself (Exodus 23:20-23; 24:9-18). The Gospel accounts, however (which 
  were not formalized until many years later, after the teachings of Paul concerning 
  the Druid Hesus, and after the mysteries of the Greeks and Egyptians, were wholly 
  assimilated into the doctrines of the early Church), reflected the composite 
  elements of this new world view--which were still based squarely and foremost 
  in the oral tradition of Moses and the Prophets. There was no break in tradition 
  according to Paul and the other members<i> </i>of the<i> Fellowship of the Mystery</i>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Simon Peter, of course, was such an initiate. And even if he 
  seems not to have fully understood, or not to have consented to the doctrines 
  of Paul at the beginning (for reasons we shall soon discover), he is fully in 
  line with them at the end. In the meantime he and Jochanan (John) will become 
  major figures in the traditions of the Kabbalah. (Their secret teachings, their 
  <i>Merkabah</i> visions and their names, will pass over into traditions of the 
  Rabbis, as we have already surmised, via R. Eliezer and others). John appears 
  on the Left hand side of the Tree of Life, the side appointed to the priesthood--to 
  Levi. It is said in the Gospels that he is the son of the priest Zacharias (Luke 
  1:67-80). But this too is a wholly apocryphal account. We do not want to fail 
  to see how the Scriptures were constructed. This Zacharias is connected by name 
  to the end-days prophecies of Zechariah, the son of <i>Berechia</i> (Zech.1:1), 
  which in turn involve the end-days prophecies of Isaiah (Isa.8:2) from which 
  John preached. There is a string of connections here, one leading to the other. 
  Thus John (the spirit of Elijah in his time...see Malachi, chapter 4 and Matthew 
  11:7-15), looking toward the last days, and with the prophetic world-view of 
  the Essene Teacher of Righteousness, will say: <i>Now is the axe laid to the 
  root of the trees: Every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit 
  is hewn down, and cast into the fire. </i>(Luke 3:9). (And please recall here 
  that Luke, the author of this narrative, is a disciple of Paul, as was Mark, 
  and fittingly, as was John when he and Paul resided together at Ephesus--Eph(raim)-(H)esus.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is in apocalyptic literature 
    that we find the first appearance of ideas of a specifically mystical character, 
    reserved for the elect. Scholars do not agree on whether the origins of this 
    literature are to be found among the Pharisees and their disciples or among 
    the Essenes, and it is quite possible that apocalyptic tendencies appeared 
    in both. It is known from Josephus that the Essenes possessed a literature 
    which was both magical and angelogical in content. His silence concerning 
    their apocalyptic ideas can be understood as his desire to conceal this aspect 
    of contemporary Judaism from his (uninitiated readers). The discovery of the 
    literary remains of the Qumran sect show that such ideas found a haven among 
    them. They possessed the original Book of Enoch, both in Hebrew and AramaicIn 
    fact, traditions resembling those embedded in THE BOOK OF ENOCH found their 
    way into rabbinic Judaism at the time of the Tannaim and Amoraim, and it is 
    impossible to determine precisely the breeding ground of this type of tradition 
    until the problems presented by the discovery of the Qumran writings have 
    been solved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Book of Enoch was followed 
    by apocalyptic writing up to the time of the Tannaim, and in different ways, 
    even later. Esoteric knowledge of these books touched not only upon the revelation 
    of the end of time and its awesome terrors, but also upon the structure of 
    the hidden world and its inhabitants: heaven, the Garden of Eden, and Gehinnom, 
    angels and evil spirits, and the fate of the souls in this hidden world. ABOVE 
    THIS ARE REVELATIONS CONCERNING THE THRONE OF GLORY AND ITS OCCUPANT (Ezekiel 
    1:5), WHICH SHOULD APPARENTLY BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE 'WONDERFUL SECRETS' OF 
    GOD MENTIONED BY THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here a link can be established 
    between this literature and the much later traditions concerning (THE MYSTERIES 
    OF CREATION, AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DIVINE CHARIOT OF GOD). It is not just 
    the content of these ideas which is considered esoteric; THEIR AUTHORS TOO 
    HID THEIR OWN INDIVIDUALITY AND THEIR NAMES, concealing themselves behind 
    biblical characters like Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Baruch, Daniel, Ezra, 
    and others. </font>(And may we point out that they also hid their own identities 
    behind one main archetypal personality named Jehoshua, or Jesus)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    THIS SELF-CONCEALMENT, which was completely successful, has made it extremely 
    difficult to determine the historical and social milieu of the authors. This 
    pseudepigraphical pattern continued within the mystical tradition in the centuries 
    that followed. The clear tendency toward asceticism as a way of preparing 
    for the reception of the mystical tradition, which is already attested to 
    in the last chapter of the Book of Enoch, becomes a fundamental principle 
    for the apocalyptics, the Essenes, and the circle of Merkabah (Divine Chariot) 
    mystics who succeeded them.&quot; </font>Kabbalah, by Gershom Scholem, p.10<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The other side of the Oracle, the Right side of the Tree, belongs 
  to the tribe of Judah, to the office of king Messiah, as it is written: <i>And 
  he hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father. </i>(Revelation 1:6). 
  But if the appointed Messiahs of Judah were not to come until the last days, 
  in the West, in the time of the Eighth sefira (Romans 10:1-4), who would assume 
  this place at the Fifth sefira named Power in that time? As we have already 
  seen, Simon Magus was trying to fill the spot. But was not Simon Peter from 
  the tribe of Simeon? (For all Kabbalistic purposes he was). Did not Simeon go 
  up with Judah into his lot in ancient time, as a kind of alter-ego? (Judges 
  1:1-3). Was it not written: <i>Simeon and Levi are brethren...I will divide 
  them in Jacob, and scatter </i>(separate)<i> them in Israel. </i> (Genesis 49:5-7). 
  Why wouldn't Simon Peter feel compelled to stand on the side of the <i>Circumcision</i> 
  and protect the doctrines of the true Messiah until the true Messiah(s) appeared 
  themselves on the Right Hand side of the Tree in the fulness of time? Especially, 
  as we said, since this Simon Magus was going throughout the empire laying claim 
  to it himself? Peter, we must assume, would dutifully relinquish his claim to 
  the place when the times required it, when <i>He whose right it is</i>, finally

  of this sublime mystery (and into a partial answer to the question: &quot;Who 
  was Jesus?&quot;), but we will be able to see right into the dilemma that Paul 
  faced in his own time. For how could this one solitary man (albeit a &quot;Jew 
  of Jews,&quot; and a &quot;pharisee of pharisees&quot;), appear among the learned 
  of his time, and in an atmosphere of so much delusion and pretense, and put 
  &quot;himself&quot; forward as the really true chosen one, the avitar of his 
  time?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He couldn't of course, as he himself wrote: <i>He who speaks

  of Christ</font> <font size="+1">speaking of every other dimension and corner 
  of the Mystery than his own. (Please understand Matthew 11:1-6, 25-27). He had 
  to leave it to others to discover through their own inquiries and inspirations 
  who he was. Not that it really mattered to him then, as he wrote: <i>I seek 
  to know nothing among you but Christ, and him crucified. </i>There were, of 
  course, those who were close enough for him to divulge it. What was divulged 
  helped give rise to many of the doctrines of the subsequent schools of Christian 
  Gnostics, in fact to the whole Arian controversy three centuries later...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If, however, we read Paul's 
    account of his revelation at Damascus without any presuppositions in our minds 
    derived from the much later accounts in Acts, we begin to appreciate what 
    enormous claims Paul was making. We have already seen one instance where the 
    New English Bible translation plays down Paul's claims, but in another phrase, 
    this translation plays them down even more. For where the New English Bible 
    has 'God...chose to reveal his Son to me and through me' (Galatians 1:16), 
    what the Greek actually says is '...TO REVEAL HIS SON IN ME.' PAUL IS SAYING, 
    QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY, THAT HE IS HIMSELF THE INCARNATION OF THE SON OF 
    GOD. He is thus claiming to have a higher status in his new religion than 
    was claimed for Moses in Judaism. It may be replied that Paul is here only 
    claiming for himself what, in his view, is possible for every Christian: an 
    identification and merging with the personality of Jesus as divine saviour; 
    Christ, it may be said, is, 'in' every Christian, just as every Christian 
    is 'in' Christ. Even so, Paul is claiming to be the first person in whom this 
    miraculous merging has taken place. His 'revelation' is thus more even than 
    a revelation: it is a transformation and a deification of Paul himself as 
    the supreme manifestation of the phenomenon of impregnation by God. Other 
    Christians were able to partake of this state, having been shown the way by 
    Paul, just as other Buddhists may find Nirvana, having been shown the way 
    by the Buddha; but Paul, like the Buddha, remains pre-eminent and quasi-divine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further confirmation of Paul's 
    sense of his own uniqueness can be found in his letters. Thus, he claims that 
    he has supreme mystical experience, quite apart from his Damascus revelation: 
    that he was caught up to THE 'THIRD HEAVEN,' and that he was 'caught up INTO 
    PARADISE and heard words so secret that human lips may not repeat them.' </font>(2 
    Corinthians 12:2,3)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Even more important 
    for an understanding of Paul's view of his own status is his claim to have 
    special marks or stigmata on his body, showing the depth of his self identification 
    with the sufferings of Jesus on the cross. </font>(See Galatians 6:17)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">....Thus 
    the stigmata of Paul, whether self-inflicted or psychosomatically produced, 
    made him, in his own eyes and those of his followers, the supreme embodiment

<p><font size="+1">Macobby is among those in our time who do indeed view Paul 
  as a self-possessed and even self-hating Jewish charlatan, like Simon Magus, 
  who found and employed any means possible to rise to the top of his religious 
  class and to make a name for himself--indeed by any means possible to exact 
  a kind of supressed vengeance on the Jewish leaders of his time because of their 
  rejection of him. But Paul was compelled by other realities, as we are seeing: 
  <i>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity 
  is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. </i>(1 Corinthians 
  9:16). He was also compelled by the words: <i>And to his son will I give one 
  tribe </i>(Benjamin)<i>, that David my servant may have a light always before 
  me in Jerusalem. The city which I have chosen to put My Name there. </i>(1 Kings 
  11:31-36; 12:21). Was not Benjamin himself born on the way to Ephrath, which 
  is Bethlehem? Was he not also named &quot;Son of the Right Hand?&quot; (Genesis 
  35:16-20). Is not Paul also linked to the mysteries of Hermes-Mercurius-the 
  Thrice Majestic on the Tree of Life? (Acts 4:12). Is not the mother of Mercury 
  named Maia...(Mary)? As Saul preceded David to the throne of Israel, so Paul 
  (Saul) precedes D.V.D. on the limbs of the sacred Oracle. And again, as Elisha 
  followed Elijah in the Book of Kings, so Paul (Elisha ben Abuyah) followed John 
  the Baptist in the affairs of those times. (2 Kings 2:11-15; Matthew 11:14):</font></p>

    sources are of inestimable value to the historian. These sources help us form 
    an opinion of the man.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul is not a proper name. It signifies 
    'the little one.' The author of Acts states that his name was Saul--but it 
    appears that he (Paul) knew no more about it than we do--and changed the P 
    of Paul into an S, to make the Hebrew name Saul. So the author of the 'we' 
    portion of Acts always call him Paul. Passing under an assumed name the rabbis 
    called him Acher, 'another,' i.e., one who passes under another or assumed 
    name.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They maintain that his name was 
    Elisha ben Abuyah. But this name must be fictitious, because it is a direct 
    and express reference to Paul's theology. It signifies the 'saving deity, 
    son of the Father God.' And Paul was the author of the 'Son of God' doctrine. 
    The fact is, he is known to the world under his assumed name only.&quot; </font>The

<p><font size="+1">Thus Paul himself says:<i> As deceivers and yet true, as unknown 
  and yet well known. </i>(2 Corinthians 6:8,9). And in light of it all the question 
  must be revisited: Just who was it that went up into Paradise and returned in 
  peace? </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Elisha ben Abuyah...entered 
    the Pards (PaRaDiSe) and became a heretic, known as Aher, 'that other one.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Distinct from the exposition of 
    the Merkabah (the Divine Chariot) which the rabbis gave on the earth below 
    was the ecstatic contemplation of the Merkabah experienced as an ascent to 
    the heavens, namely...to the Merkabah, through entering Pards (Paradise). 
    This was not a matter for exposition and interpretation but of vision and 
    personal experience. This transition, which once again connects the revelations 
    of the Merkabah with the apocalyptic traditions, is mentioned in the Talmud 
    alongside of the exegetical traditions (Hag.14b). It concerns the four sages 
    who 'entered pards.' Their fate demonstrates that here we are dealing with 
    spiritual experiences which were achieved by contemplation and ecstacy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simon ben Azzai 'looked and died;' 
    Ben Zoma 'looked and was smitten' (mentally); Elisha ben Abuyah, called Aher 
    ('other'), forsook rabbinic Judaism and 'cut the shoots,' apparently becoming 
    a dualistic Gnostic. R. Akiva alone 'entered in peace and left in peace.' 
    or in another reading, 'ascended in peace and descended in peace.'&quot;</font> 
    Kabbalah, by Gershom Scholem, pp.13,14<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">How is it that Akiba alone &quot;ascended in peace and descended 
  (again) in peace?&quot; Was it really he or Elisha ben Abuyah? Yes, it was Akiba. 
  How is it?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Both Mishna and Talmud (Hag 
    2:1 and the corresponding Gemara in both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud) 
    show that, in the first century of the common era, esoteric traditions existed 
    within these areas, and severe limitations were placed on public discussion 
    of such subjects: 'The story of Creation should not be expounded before two 
    persons, nor the chapter on the Chariot before one person, unless he is a 
    sage and already has an independent understanding on the matter.'...Such an 
    attitude is expressed in the continuation of the Mishna quoted above: 'Whoever 
    ponders on four things, it were better for him if he had not come into the 
    world: what is above, what is below, what was before time, and what will be 
    hereafter.'&quot; </font>Scholem, p.12<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus according to the dictates of the Rabbis themselves, Akiba 
  went up into the PRDS. He didn't look. He didn't see anything. He didn't ask 
  any questions. And he came down in peace. Paul on the other hand, went up. He 
  looked. He inquired. He saw (everything). And came down troubled and persecuted 
  on every side. (See Isaiah 6:5). He did not only personally encounter the Metatron, 
  the Angel of Divine Presence (in both his Universal Four-handed, and then Two-handed 
  forms, as did John the Baptist--Arjuna), but he learned of his own place on 
  the Tree of Life. Looking into the oracles, realizing that the spirit of Moses 
  (the true interpreter of the Torah) had descended to take up residence in his 
  own soul, and then seeing his own spirit descending on the Tree of Life into 
  that of the messiah(s) in the last day, he says: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>I 
    WILL COME TO VISIONS AND REVELATIONS OF THE LORD</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Corinthians, chapter 12)...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul is transported here and is speaking as one of the anointed 
  ones in the last day (see Zechariah, chapter 4), as it is also written: <i>The 
  kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, which made a marriage for his son. 
  </i>(Matthew 22:2-14). Then alluding to the entire structure of the Mystery 
  of Christ, and either speaking of himself, or of John the Baptist (see Matthew 
  11:1-11), or both as it is also written: &quot;The face of one sefiroth turns 
  toward another, developing all the paths of influence,&quot; he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">I knew a man in Christ above (Ten and Four) years ago,

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul is alluding here to the Essene Book of Enoch, in which 
  is found a description of Enoch's ascent to the Third Heaven:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul has clearly discovered his own place on the Cosmic Tree. 
  Then speaking in the spirit of his former self, or of all the dimensions of 
  the Sefiroth together, he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I know such a man, (whether in the Body, or out of 
    the Body, I cannot tell: God knoweth);</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">How that he was </font>CAUGHT UP INTO PARADISE</i><i><font size="+1">, 
    and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Of such a one will I glory; yet of myself I will not glory, 
    but in mine infirmities.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; 
    for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of 
    me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the 
    abundance of revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, the 
    messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 12:3-7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The thorn in Paul's flesh is no doubt partly the effects of 
  his own lower nature pulling down on his higher self. It reflects his struggles 
  with sexuality, with the meaning of love, and celibacy, determined as he had 
  become to keep himself pure for his own soul-mate to which he would be united 
  at the end of the age. 1 Corinthians 7:,6-8). (Maccoby has many evil assessments 
  to make of Paul's motives here as well). But Paul (that old bald-headed Elisha), 
  was in every way the spiritual warrior (and, as we shall come to see, a true 
  and faithful lover). This thorn no doubt also represented those pressures on 
  his own mind that were tempting him to doubt the substance of his own revelations, 
  and to abandon what others were accusing him of, his heresy and delusions. Thus 
  this thorn was also the people themselves, and the care that Paul had to exercise 
  on their behalf despite their own inabilities to enter into his field of vision, 
  or to rise above the level of their own earthly concerns. Elisha ben Abuyah 
  entered the Pards, said the rabbis, and became a heretic. They said he gave 
  himself over to dualism, a belief in more than One God. We are seeing, however, 
  how this Elisha (Paul, for the lack of another name as yet), was an adept in 
  the very highest of spiritual sciences, and that he understood--from the most 
  profound kabbalistic point of view--the nature and the true meaning of the Unity 
  of All Things...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;R. Simeon opened his discourse 
    with the text: 'And I put my words in thy mouth.' (Is.51:16). He said, 'How 
    greatly is it incumbent on a man to study the Torah day and night! (see Acts 
    20:31). For the Holy One, blessed be He, is attentive to the voice of those 
    who occupy themselves with the Torah, AND THROUGH EACH FRESH DISCOVERY MADE 
    BY THEM IN THE TORAH IS A NEW HEAVEN CREATED. Our teachers have told us that 
    at the moment when a man expounds something new in the Torah, his utterance 
    ascends before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He takes it up and kisses 
    it and crowns it with Seventy crowns of graven and inscribed letters. When 
    a new idea is formulated in the field of esoteric wisdom, it ascends and rests 
    on the head of the 'Zaddik, the Life of the Universe.'...And inasmuch as all 
    the words of the Ancient of Days are words of wisdom comprising sublime and 
    hidden mysteries, that hidden word of wisdom that was discovered here when 
    it ascends is joined with the words of the Ancient of Days, and becomes an 
    integral part of them </font>(see 2 Timothy 4:8, 18)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for other new expositions of 
    the Torah, they present themselves before the Holy One, blessed be He, and 
    ascend and become 'earths of the living,' then they descend and become absorbed 
    into one earth, whereby a new earth emerges through that new discovery in 
    the Torah. This is implied in the verse: 'For as the new heavens and the new 
    earth, which I am making, rise up before me...' (Isaiah 66:22). (See Revelation 
    21:1). It is not written, 'I have made,' but 'I am making,' signifying continual 
    creation out of new ideas discovered in the Torah. Further it is written: 
    'AND I HAVE PLACED MY WORDS IN THY MOUTH, AND WITH A SHADOW OF MY HAND HAVE 
    I COVERED THEE, TO PLANT A HEAVEN, AND TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH.' 
    (Isaiah 511:16). It does not say 'the heaven,' but 'a heaven,' Said R. Eleazer: 
    WHAT SIGNIIFIETH, &quot;WITH THE SHADOW OF MY HAND HAVE I COVERED THEE&quot;' 
    He replied 'When the Torah was delivered to Moses, there appeared myriads 
    of heavenly angels ready to consume him with fiery breath, but the Holy One, 
    blessed be He, sheltered him. Similarly now when the new word ascends and 
    is crowned and presents itself before the Holy One, blessed be He, He covers 
    and protects the word, and also shelters the author of that word, so that 
    the angels should not become aware of him and so be filled with jealousy, 
    until that word is transformed into a new heaven and a new earth. This is 
    the meaning of the passage, 'And with the shadow of my hand have I covered 
    thee, to plant a heaven and to lay the foundation of the earth.'&quot; </font>Prologue

<p><font size="+1">Of those Zionists who have gone backwards in our times--away 
  from the Light that is descending again, but this time at the Western ends of 
  the earth--of those who have truly &quot;cut the shoots,&quot; Elisha says: 
  <i>Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may 
  be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal for God, but not according 
  to Knowledge (Daat). For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going 
  about to establish their own </i>(&quot;If we are not for ourselves, who will 
  be for us? If we do not save ourselves, who will save us?&quot;)<i>, have not

    (on His Throne) and said, 'Perhaps there are two powers,' as though indicating 
    Metatron as a second deity...It was proved to Elisha that Metatron could not 
    be a second deity by the fact that Metatron received 60 strokes with fiery 
    rods' to demonstrate that Metatron was not a god, but an angel, and could 
    be punished. This image refers frequently in different contexts in Gnostic 
    literature and is associated with various figures of the heavenly realm. It

<p><font size="+1">In the light of these cryptic passages we can fathom Paul's 
  other words which say: <i>Till I come...</i>(1 Timothy 4:13-16); <i>The rest 
  will I set in order when I come...</i>(1 Cor.11:34); <i>And I am sure that, 
  when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel 
  of Christ. </i>(Romans 15:29). <i>My little children, of whom I travail in birth 
  again until Christ be formed in you. </i>(Galatians 4:19); <i>A crown that he

<p><font size="+1">And of course those words that convinced so many others that 
  Paul expected the return of Christ in his own times:</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>THEN WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN shall be caught up 
    together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air...</i>(1 Thessalonians 
    4:17).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">As we can see now, Paul is not speaking of himself in his times, 
  but from the place on the Tree of Life named Majesty in our times, and apart 
  from those who will be called upon to lay down their lives for these things 
  on the other side of the Oracle--just as John the Baptist and others laid down 
  their lives for these things at the place named Love. And then, because Paul 
  knew that the people's sojourn here at the Western ends of the Earth would mirror 
  Israel's sojourn in Egypt in ancient times (Genesis 15:13-16), we see that he 
  is alluding to an allegorical description of Israel's deliverance from Egypt 
  in the Book of Exodus--one which has also eluded those literalists in our times 
  who are waiting to be physically lifted off the earth in a great &quot;rapture,&quot; 
  defying the laws of Nature, and leaving the rest of us here alone to suffer 
  the tribulations of the last days. They are right in that respect: others will 
  suffer the tribulations on their behalf. It will not be physical bodies that 
  will be caught up as a result, however, but people's minds:</font></p>

    is the Voice of Many Waters--many nations, many peoples)</font><i><font size="+1">, 
    and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all 
    people, for all the earth is mine.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, an holy 
    nation...</font></i></p>

    the Lord hath spoken we will do...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Lord said to Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a 
    Thick Cloud, that the people may hear when I speak unto thee, and believe

<p><font size="+1">The following is one of the few remains of Israel ben Eliezer's 
  (the founder of the modern Hasidic movement), own writings. Israel's life opened 
  the way for Paul's spirit to descend again into our times--to a complete encounter 
  with the Lunar, or Feminine side of the Tree of Life. His words reflected the 
  exact meaning of Paul's words when he wrote:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For on the day of the New 
    Year...I engaged in an ascent of the soul, as you know that I do, and saw 
    wonderous things in that vision that I never saw before since the day that 
    I attained to maturity. That which I saw and learned in my ascent is impossible 
    to describe or even relate from mouth to mouth. But as I returned to the lower 
    garden of Eden I saw many souls, both of the living and of the dead, those 
    known to me and those unknown. There were more than could be counted and they 
    ran to and fro from world to world through the path provided by that column 
    known to the adepts of the hidden science. They were all in such a state of 
    GREAT RAPTURE, that the mouth would be worn out if it attempted to describe 
    it, and the physical ear too delicate to hear it...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the wicked repented of 
    their sins and were pardoned, FOR IT WAS A TIME OF MUCH GRACE...It was a marvel 
    that the repentance was accepted of so many you know. They also enjoyed great 
    Rapture and ascended, as mentioned before. </font>(see Revelation 12:5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus all the worlds became united 
    and they ascend so that immeasurable rapture and great delight is experienced. 
    YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IN THE ANALOGY OF THE RAPTURE OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM 
    IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD. HOW MUCH MORE AT THIS ELEVATED STAGE.&quot; </font>The
