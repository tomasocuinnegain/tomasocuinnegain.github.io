<p align="center"><font size="+2">THE DIVINE MYSTERY PLAY</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+2">The Book of Job</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The people are assembled on the grass, or on the 
  seats of the outdoor theater in front of the stage. These are early times--the 
  Homeric age, the age of the Sibyllines and the Delphic oracles. It is centuries 
  before the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles will grip the imagination of the 
  Grecian mind. It is a time when the Hebrew mysteries were still a hidden Oracle 
  in the center of the Earth. The conversation ceases, all is quiet. The narrator 
  appears on stage:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>&quot;There</i></font> <i><font size="+1">was a man in 
    the land of Uz, </font></i><font size="3">(Uz? this is clearly a fictitious, 
    or rather a far-off place)</font><i><font size="+1">, whose name was Job; 
    and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed 
    evil.&quot;</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The participants in the drama (the audience in this case) immediately 
  understand that this is a mystery play. It is an initiation into the Hebrew 
  mysteries, and into the creative and complex genius of the Hebrew state of mind. 
  Those who are initiated into the historical and prophetic framework of the play, 
  into the cast of characters and the dialogue between them, may count themselves 
  among those who are also perfect and upright in the eyes of God. (Those in time 
  who cannot understand it may count themselves among those who came unprepared 
  into the secret grove, and as Paul would say centuries later: who <i>heard unspeakable 
  words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter</i>). </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And there was born unto him Seven sons and Three daughters.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Immediately we realize that this is an initiation into the 
  mysteries of the 10 sefirot of the Tree of Life. It is journey to the ends of 
  the earth, and to the fulness of time. It is a journey back to the garden of 
  Eden, and back to the root of this Mystery which lies far off in the West. But 
  right now the Great Dragon lies beneath them, under foot. It is also a journey 
  into the depths of human consciousness. But more than that. It is a spiritual 
  journey into the very depths of the Mind of God itself. &quot;Come no closer 
  you who fear to enter here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The narrator continues while the figure of Job takes its place 
  on the stage, and sits with his back to the audience for reasons that the initiated 
  fully understand. Mute characters come and go, messengers from Satan to test 
  Job's soul. The play has begun. Then the earth shakes with the very voice of 
  God, or is it Satan, and so begins the historic dialogue, the ages-long confrontation, 
  the conflict of terms (or so it seems), between God (or is it Satan) and his 
  righteous servant Job. One recent study suggests that God is actually bi-polar, 
  which accounts for the violent mood-swings of Nature, and the drastic interludes 
  between war and peace, always resulting in war again, and the abundance of human 
  suffering in the earth. Carl Jung, in his <i>Answer to Job</i>, says that in 
  the exchange between the two, God realizes at some cosmic level that Job is 
  more righteous than Himself (of course Job does not have the work of Creation 
  before him), and that His ultimate resolution to this conflict is to descend 
  and incarnate Himself in human form, to bear upon Himself the results of His 
  own <i>cruelties </i>and <i>excesses</i>. Thus the sublime but deep and historic 
  implication of the Gospels, which are themselves a continuation of the dramatic 
  tradition in the Hebrew Scriptures, and Job's words: <i>For I know that my redeemer 
  liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth</i>. (Job 19:25)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And therefore the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">AGAIN there was a day when the sons of God came to present 
    themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself 
    before the Lord...</font></i><font size="+1">(Job 2:1).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Enter Job's three friends. They appear on stage from the Right 
  side and the Left. (Job 2:11). </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">So they sat down with him upon the ground SEVEN days and 
    SEVEN nights, and none spake a word unto him </font></i><font size="3">(yet)</font><font size="+1"><i> 
    for they saw that his grief was very great. </i>(2:12, 13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Then Job begins his first soliloquy. The uninitiated think 
  that he speaking of himself. Those, however, who know the secret intent, and 
  the historic meaning of the drama, know that Job's words are referring to the 
  spirit of Cain in the world, and of all the sons of Darkness who will come to 
  power, and to their own state of perfection in the last days. The script is 
  paraphrasing from Genesis 4:1 (the birth of Cain) when it says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The narrator: </font><i><font size="+1">After this opened 
    Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And Job spoke and said.</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Job: <i>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night 
    in which it was said, There is a manchild conceived.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Let that day be darkness, let not God regard it from above, 
    neither let the light shine upon it...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For now I should have lain still and been quiet, I should 
    have slept: then had I been at rest,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">With kings and counselors of the earth, which built desolate 
    places for themselves...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary 
    be at rest...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the thing that I greatly feared is come upon me, and 
    that which I was afraid of has come unto me...</font></i><font size="+1">(Job 
    3:1-26).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The entire script is a prophecy of the last days. It anticipates 
  the Book of 1 John, as well as the words at 2 Thessalonians 1:4-10. (KJV). It 
  also represents the journey that Job himself must take to his own state of Christ-mindedness. 
  He and God retort, back and forth, psychological paradoxes, pi, Freudian and 
  Jungian analyses, subliminal criticisms, historical theory, archetypal symbols, 
  Cabalistic impressions fly through the vortex that separates their minds, until 
  at last the relationship is made and both are thinking like each other and for 
  each other. Neither relented, and neither gave up on the other. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nor does Job yield to the misplaced theological reasonings 
  of his three friends. The audience knows that Job is speaking as an oracle. 
  El'i-phaz, Bildad and Zophar are presented as those who are not aware of this. 
  They represent religious <i>literalists </i>everywhere, throughout all times 
  (and most particularly our own), immature in spirit, yet zealous for God, who 
  unwittingly cast the ideas and words they have learned from the prophets back 
  at the prophets themselves. We can sense Job groaning, and see the audience 
  knowingly shaking its head, as they hear El'i-phaz saying:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it touchest 
    thee, and thou art troubled...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Remember, I pray thee, whoever perished being innocent? 
    or where were the righteous cut off?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow 
    wickedness, reap the same...</font></i><font size="+1">(Job 4:5-8).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The three friends do not (in the roles that they have been 
  given) realize that the words that they are speaking are really directed at 
  themselves, and against the spiritual situation that they have created for themselves 
  among the sons of Darkness in the last days. El'i-phaz seals it when he is made 
  to say: <i>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea thine own lips testify 
  against thee.</i> (Job 15:6).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">An airy figure appears on stage, circumambulating Job, and 
  then in a cryptic voice lets the audience in on a vision--a prophecy of the 
  last times--that all may share. Some will understand it, some will not: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received 
    a little thereof.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep 
    falleth on men.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones 
    to shake.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh 
    stood up:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: 
    an Image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice saying,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be 
    more pure than his maker?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Job 4:12-21).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And so goes the drama, from one scene to another, from one 
  revelation to another. Everyone of the characters, each in their turn, are expounding 
  on secret matters, esoteric precepts, historical concepts, spiritual realities 
  and otherwise seemingly disconnected ideas that are interjected this way and 
  that way into the text, all of which confound the literal and natural mind, 
  but which will nevertheless unfold and be made clear in the last days. <i>Let 
  them who speak, </i>Peter says, <i>speak as the oracles of God</i>. The <i>dramatas 
  personae</i> in the Mystery Play of Job do. It is a marvelous script, and has 
  been a sublime performance. The stage is set for the final act. And God does 
  repent that He had to create the world in this way. There was no other way to 
  do it and still achieve the same spiritual, psychological and emotional results. 
  There was no other way to be created <i>in the Image of God</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In his <i>The Book of Job as a Greek Tragedy</i>, Horace M. 
  Kallen pursues the belief that this ancient book is just that: a drama written 
  in Hebrew form, with Hebrew archetypes rather than Greek, but nevertheless in 
  the Greek spirit of the theatre. He says,</font> <font size="+1">"It is now 
  more than half a century since I restored the Book of Job to what I believe 
  was its original form--that of a Greek tragedy in the manner of Euripides:" 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The ancient Jews appear to 
    have known nothing, of themselves, about the theatre or its implications in 
    art and society: all that they did know seems to have derived from the Greeks…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Moulten suggests that this is 
    due to the lack of theatre, and attributes to this lack, the spread of the 
    obvious dramatic impulse among the Jews through other literary forms, until 
    epic, lyric, discourse, are all drawn together…For him, hence, the Book of 
    Job, the bulk of which is in dialogue form, is a complete and integrated composition, 
    'a dramatic poem framed in an epic life,' but not a drama. For Ganung, Job 
    is an 'epic of the inner life,' but not a drama; for Nathaniel Schmidt it 
    is at most a dialogue after the fashion of Plato, or more generously, of 'Aeschylus 
    in Prometheus Bound,' but not a drama. Most writers, in fact, who assign Job 
    any dramatic character at all, attribute this character to Greek influence, 
    and deny the nativity of dramatic form to Jewish soil&quot;…(pp.3,4).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Kallen's remedy comes in knowing which way to point in this 
  instance to "Jewish soil"--not southwards to Palestine, but Northwards toward 
  the center of Europe--and in knowing how the dramatic arts fell out of this 
  higher state of mind into the Greek way of life to begin with (as did the whole 
  oral tradition), all in humanity's attempt to emulate in their own natural lives 
  the meanings of the mysteries of life itself. Except that the <i>Greeks</i> 
  wound up, not with the reality but with images of it: with stage plays and stage 
  actors, and finally (with marvelous and important exceptions, of course), with 
  an industry full of movie and television <i>stars</i> who, in keeping with the 
  decadence of these times (see 2 Timothy 3:-5), and chasing the bright lights 
  of personal fame and fortune, have become blatantly shallow-minded, frivalous, 
  deceptive, cliched, dirty-mouthed, self-important, violent, unaware, insincere, 
  and for sale, whose chief occupation is more to tend their own sense of themselves 
  in the eyes of the public, than the higher minds of those who feed upon those 
  images. For there are really only two kinds of performing artists, those who 
  want us to go away thinking about them and their careers, and those who want 
  us to go away thinking of other things, of higher things, of things other than 
  themselves and ourselves. (Compare Daniel 12:3)...</font></p>

    musicians, artists, and politicians, for instance,are almost without exception 
    sick people: and what are they suffering from? First of all from an extraordinary 
    opinion of themselves...and then from being prepared to take offense at our 
    lack of understanding and appreciation.&quot; </font>P.D. Ouspensky, In Search 
    of the Miracuulous, p.152<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And in our own frenzy to be entertained and a-mused by these 
  kinds of celebrities who want their own names and images enshrined in our brainstems--(We 
  are mad upon our idols...Jeremiah 50:38)--we fail to see that the Dark consortium 
  is now complete. Government and industry, the sports world, the financial world, 
  advertising and the mass media, show business, education, the military and the 
  church, are all now hand in hand. The social policies and agendas of each of 
  these institutions, are those of the others. We fail to see that the children 
  of Darkness have finally been <i>bound in a bundle</i>. (Matthew 13:37-43; Revelation 
  18:2; Prov.11:21).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If that form of Judaism that was being practiced in Central 
  Europe (as we shall come to see in the following chapters) knew nothing of "the 
  theatre" it was because the world itself was its theatre; its stage the past, 
  the present, and the future:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THEATRE…&quot;One way of telling 
    a story is to act it out. An acted story is called a play. The actors in the 
    play usually speak as they act out their parts. Plays as a rule are given 
    in theatres. The first theatres that we know of were built by the ancient 
    Greeks. Their theatres were not much like ours. They were all outdoors. The 
    seats on a sloping hillside. The stage was a circle of grass. At first the 
    Greek theatres were not used for plays. They were used for songs and dances 
    in honour of the Greek gods.&quot; From a Children's Encyclopedia. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The development of Greek 
    drama stems from the Dithyrambos (8th and 7th centuries B.C.) which was a 
    dance performed around an altar and accompanied by songs honouring the god 
    Dionysus </font>(the god of the Vine...John 15)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    whose life and deeds were thus glorified. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next step was the introduction 
    of an individual engaged in dialogue with the chorus, a development which 
    </font>probably<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> originated in Attica, 
    Greece, in the 6th century B.C. The content of this 'play' gradually became 
    enlarged, Demeter and other Greek </font>(notions of the)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    deities also being honoured…At first the performances took place in the open 
    air </font>(as did every Druid service)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    within a circle near a temple of the deities being honoured…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a miraculous fact that the 
    work of the first dramatist, Aeschylus, shows elements of genuine dramatic 
    plot and of dramatic psychology. Thought and poetic presentation are equally

    end of a long literary development.&quot; </font>From a Big People's Encyclopedia<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">J. M. Roberts, in his <i>Pagan Christs</i>, describing the 
  elements of the Divine Mystery Play as it is presented in the Gospels, says: 
  "As the story stands Jesus partakes with his disciples of the Passover, an evening 
  meal. After a brief dialogue they sing a hymn and proceed in darkness (the long 
  night of the Mystery) to the Mount of Olives (to the Foot of the Mystery…see 
  Zecharaiah 14:4). Nothing is said of what happened or was spoken on the way." 
  </font>(p.49)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is not very likely that 
    anyone who went to the grave on the first Easter Sunday met an angel who announced 
    that Jesus had been raised from the dead. Modern exegetes are unanimous in 
    interpreting the angel as a legendary figure, drawn from apocalyptic literature 
    and used as a mouthpiece for the faith of the early church…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But mythical though he is, the 
    angel is the centerpiece of the story, and if we interpret his role properly 
    we will have answered many of the questions that cluster around Jesus' tomb. 
    In contrast to the stone at the tomb, which functions in the Easter drama 
    like a silent Greek choragus who warns us how not to interpret the scene, 
    the angel has a speaking part and he directs us positively to what the Jerusalem 
    church thought was the significance of Jesus' grave. The angel was invented 
    to act as a role model for the listener, and he speaks forth what the community 
    thought was the proper response to the empty tomb, namely the affirmation 
    'Jesus has been raised.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who, then, is this angel? I propose 
    that we take him for what he really is: not a supernatural being who actually 
    appeared in a tomb one Sunday morning, but a dramatic persona who was invented 
    to play a role in the Christian legend. Later readers of the legend who mistake 
    him for a real angel…misunderstood the literary form, and therefore the point 
    of Mark's Gospel. The Easter narrative, both in its pre-Marcan oral form and 
    in the gospel version, is a legend, not a historical account. It is structured 
    in the form of a drama, a religious play, and therefore could be mistaken 
    for a piece of history. However, in order to grasp the story according to 
    its proper literary form--and therefore the way in which it was originally 
    meant to be understood--I propose to treat the text at Mark 16:1-8 explicitly 
    as a drama, which I call Easter at the Tomb. If we look at the Easter legend 
    as a religious play, the 'angel' who appears at the tomb is, in fact, an actor 
    who recites dramatic lines that were created for him, first by the early Jerusalem 
    community…and then by the evangelist Mark.This approach may be strained at 
    points, but it does help clarify how the Easter legend developed from the 
    early oral version to Mark's written account and beyond.&quot; </font>The

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Mark, then, during Peter's 
    stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord's doings, not, however, declaring 
    all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought 
    most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But 
    when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria bringing both his own 
    notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the 
    things suitable for whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he 
    composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. 
    Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered </font>(2 
    Corinthians 12:4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, nor did he write 
    down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written

    innermost sanctuary of the truth hidden by Seven vails. Thus, in sum, he prepared 
    matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he 
    left his composition to the church in 1, verso Alexandria, where it is even

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What are we make of this? 
    The feeding of the Five Thousand and the story of the 153 fishes clearly show 
    that certain New Testament stories were composed as initiatory spiritual allegories. 
    We may call them 'initiatory' for the simple reason that they presuppose a 
    movement from the outer world of manifest form to the inner perspective of 
    genuine insight. They were intended both to entertain and to edify at an outer 
    level, designed to bring enjoyment even to children, yet they were also designed 
    to possess within a deeper, hidden dimension, reflecting the harmonic nature 
    of the cosmic pattern. However, since the unknown scholars who composed these 
    tales, based upon the ancient models, were intentionally crafting vehicles 
    for the transmission of spiritual insight, it is unlikely that they desired 
    their teaching stories ultimately to be read in literal or historical terms. 
    This was recognized by the initiated church father Origen </font>(who was 
    also branded a heretic by the emerging orthodoxy)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    who complains that 'very many mistakes have been made, because the right method 
    of examining the holy texts has not been discovered by the greater number

    from the many; but where in setting forth the sequences of things spiritual 
    there was no actual event related for the sake of the more mystic meaning. 
    Scripture interweaves the imaginative with the historical, sometimes introducing 
    what is utterly impossible, sometimes what is possible but never occurred…</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">David E. Aune, in a work entitled <i>Prophecy in Early Christianity, 
  and the Ancient Mediterranean World,</i> explores the use of oracles, not only 
  in the maintenance of the religious life of the Greco-Roman world at that time 
  but in the very formation of Christianity itself. Of those "unknown authors" 
  of the Gospels he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One issue is the problem 
    of the relationship between the prophetic utterances of Christian prophets 
    and the transmission of the sayings of Jesus. Another is concerned with the 
    Christian prophet as a charismatic exegete of the OT scriptures. If it can 
    be demonstrated that Christian prophets, speaking in the name of the risen 
    Jesus, made substantial contributions to the collection of sayings of the 
    earthly Jesus, our knowledge of the transmission of gospel tradition will 
    be immensely enriched. (p.22)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Divination may be defined as the 
    art or science of interpreting symbolic messages from the gods. Often these 
    symbols are unpredictable or even trivial. Oracles, on the other hand, are 
    messages from the gods in human language, received as statements from a god, 
    usually in response to inquiries. The term 'oracle' is also used for the place 
    where such messages are requested and received.(p.23)... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many modern NT scholars…theorized 
    that early Christian prophets played a major role in the transmission, formulation, 
    and even the creation of the sayings of Jesus. This process is thought to 
    have occurred primarily during the period (30-70 AD) when the gospel tradition 
    had not yet been written down in the form of the Gospels. According to this 
    view the oracles of Christian prophets, proclaimed in the first person as 
    utterances of the risen Lord, gradually became intermingled with sayings of 
    the historical Jesus… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the central assumptions 
    of advocates of the theory that many of the sayings of Jesus in the synoptic 
    gospels originated in early Christian prophetic activity is that Christians 
    made no essential or lasting distinction between sayings of the historical 
    Jesus and post-Easter oracles from the risen Lord. Consequently oracles in 
    the 'I' style, uttered by the risen Lord through prophetic spokesmen gradually 
    became assimilated to collections of sayings stemming from the historical 
    Jesus. Proponents of this view point to the oracles in the Apocalypse of John 
    that are in the form of sayings of the risen Jesus: (Revelation 1:17-20; esp. 
    3:20; 16:15; 22:12). Revelation 3:20 and 16:15 will serve as examples of these 
    oracles in the 'I' style: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; If anyone 
    hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, 
    and he with me.' 'Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake, 
    keeping his garments That he may not go naked and be seen exposed.' A similar 
    oracle is found in the Odes of Solomon 42:6. 'And I have risen and am among 
    them, And I speak through their mouth.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These oracle are cited for three 
    reasons: (1) they are clear indications that early Christian prophets did 
    in fact prophecy in the first person of the risen Lord. (2) the form of those 
    sayings is such that could possibly have entered the traditions of the sayings 
    of Jesus, and (3) the authority of such prophetic utterances would ensure 
    their acceptance by Christian communities as sayings of Jesus&quot;…</font>David

    the historical sayings of Jesus without first considering Pauline theology. 
    As Wilson points out, the authors of the gospels were (persons) who had gazed 
    at Jesus' life through Paul's looking glass…Without the Pauline transformation--the 
    resurrection, the ascension into heaven, the command to 'go ye therefore, 
    and teach all nations,'--Jesus' message could have survived only as the equivalent

<p><font size="+1">Every student of these affairs will begin to see how Paul's 
  gospel itself is a chief source of the later Gospel narratives (Romans 2:16), 
  thus how subtily those Gospel narratives are interwoven with the doctrines and 
  the affairs of the "historic" Paul, or rather this mysterious Paul--whose real 
  name was not Paul, or Saul, at all. (But this is the subject of another chapter). 
  The lesson is that the Jesus (or the Hesus) of the Gospels is not an historical 
  person, but is rather another of the many manifestations of the Lord, but here 
  in the personification of the Suffering Servant, the Sacrificial Victim, the 
  true Pacifist, which of necessity appears in conjunction with the Hebrew warrior 
  archetype, Jehoshua. Which is why it took the early church fifty years or more 
  to work out their spiritual frame of reference. The writers had to bring together 
  into one Corporate state of mind (according to the structure and the dimensions 
  of the Oracle) the truthes of all the other religious traditions that surrounded 
  them; merge them with fitting historical events, as well as with events that 
  they could see--by studying the oracles--would come to pass at the end of the 
  age. All of this had to be assimilated, not only to the revelations of Paul 
  but to the words of the Prophets, which the Gospels would accompany to the end 
  of the age. The Baptist was Jesus, even as he was initiating others into the 
  mystery of Jesus. Paul was Jesus in a most particular way, as we shall see, 
  as were all of the other followers of Christ at that time. When the Romans put 
  Jesus on the Cross it was thousands who were hung there, not just one. Jesus 
  (Hesus) is the central figure in the great cosmic drama of human transformation, 
  one that unites heaven and earth, and reconciles all things on earth to each 
  other; and especially those things that are said to have happened then with 
  the things that shall happen now. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE MAN WHO MAINSTREAMED 
  MAHLER</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By David Schiff</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Musicologists of the future may 
    well term the 1960s the decade of the Beatles and Gustav Mahler: the remarkable 
    unexpected flowering of Liverpudlian lyricism and the re-emergence at the 
    centenary of his birth of a composer many critics saw only as a relic of vanished 
    Vienna. No one understood this historical moment more fully, more passionately 
    and, some might say, more opportunistically than Leonard Bernstein...Bernstein's 
    first recordings of the complete Mahler symphonies...takes listeners back 
    to those days, when the release of the &quot;White Album&quot; and that of 
    Mahler's Seventh Symphony were equally revelatory.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be untrue to say that 
    Bernstein put Mahler on the map, though his words sometimes gave that impression...But 
    Bernstein redrew the map with Mahler at dead center, a paradigm shift that 
    has affected our sense of music ever since. Mahler at the center, rather than 
    at the margins, has changed the way every orchestra plans its seasons and 
    the way music historians view the 20th century...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was simply too true,&quot; 
    he explained, &quot;telling something dreadful to hear.&quot; The awful truth 
    was the premonition of three kinds of death: Mahler's own death, the death 
    of tonality and &quot;the death of our society, of our Faustian culture.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mahler's postwar reputation in 
    Europe was more mixed, but on the whole, the 1920s were the first Mahler decade. 
    Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and, especially, William Mengelberg promoted 
    Mahler's legacy, and Mahler's style had a profound, if quite divergent, influence 
    on the two leading composers of theatrical music, Alban Berg and Kurt Weill. 
    Opposition came from the anti-Semitic right, which had derided Mahler's music 
    for its &quot;Yiddish accent&quot; ever since it appeared and which portrayed 
    Mahler as the second coming of Myerbeer, the archvillain of Wagner's hate-filled 
    essay &quot;Judaism and Music.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But you did not have to be a rabid 
    anti-Semite to ignore Mahler. Wilheim Furtwangler and Arturo Toscanini, each 
    for his own reasons, never performed a Mahler symphony. After the Nazis came 
    to power in 1933, Germany and, later, Austria and occupied Europe were systematically 
    made Mahler-free..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.Though Bernstein like to give 
    the impression that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion, he 
    had stood on the shoulders of eminent Mahlerians since the early 1940s. He 
    first heard a Mahler symphony when Arthur Rodzinski conducted the Second with 
    the New York Philharmonic in 1943; Bernstein conducted the work in New York 
    and Israel </font>(understand these connections)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    in 1948, and it became his signature piece; he led it at his 1,000th concert 
    with the New York Philharmonic...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the time of (Bernstein's) Harvard 
    lectures, he had placed Mahler securely in the repertory, where his music 
    has remained ever since. But now Bernstein used Mahler to make his own prophetic 
    claims. In a verbal aria that sounded more like a High Holy Day sermon than 
    an academic lecture, Bernstein described Mahler's despair itself as a source 
    of hope for rebirth, for the re-emergence of tonality and &quot;musical poetry.&quot;

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">91 YEARS AFTER DYING, 
  MAHLER HITS HIS STRIDE</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Stephen Kinzer</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOULDER, Colo.__Classical musicians 
    sometimes apply what they call the hundred-year rule to composers. Only a 
    century after music is composed, they say, can its quality and value truly 
    be appraised. By that standard, the works of Gustav Mahler, who died in 1911, 
    should now be reaching their largest audience. Judging by the hundreds of 
    people who converged on Boulder for a Mahler festival over the weekend, his 
    place in the pantheon of musical genius is assured.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mahler's music is deeply complex 
    and almost unbearably emotional. Its great themes are despair in the face 
    of tragedy, followed by redemption and determination to live on. That message 
    perplexed his contemporaries in Europe and in the United States, where he 
    spent his final years conducting the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan 
    Opera. Many of them were far removed from the depths of human torment and 
    lived in societies where death was often idealized as something ethereal and 
    even beautiful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, after the 20th century's 
    world wars and mass slaughters, Mahler's music touches many more souls than 
    it did when was written...Mr. Oldberg said, &quot;Mahler always said his time 
    would come. Well it has. This is music for our time, and the events of September 
    11 make him more contemporary than ever. Mahler is the great prophet of the 
    idea that life involves great pain and suffering, but also that after it all, 
    there is resurrection and triumphant affirmation.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1988 the conductor Robert Olson, 
    then based at Boulder, staged the first Mahler Festival here on a budget of 
    $400. The featured musical offering was Mahler's First Symphony. Since then 
    players have performed another of the TEN symphonies each year, and then begun 
    the cycle anew. Many return year after year.</font></p>

  ON A HISTORY OF THE COSMOS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Paul Griffiths</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the most interesting points 
    in Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5...came right at the end. The work was receiving 
    its North American premier at the Brooklyn Academy of Music...with Dennis 
    Russell Davies conducting (along with the Brooklyn Youth Chorus)...and for 
    more than an hour and a half it had been supplying the composer's usual earnest 
    musical rudiments to cloth sacred writings from around the world in a 12-part 
    history of the cosmos.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When space turned around, 
    the earth heated&quot;: di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. &quot;Let the day perish 
    wherein I was born&quot;: di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. &quot;May I be a protector 
    for those without one&quot;: di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. Always the same oscillation 
    in the orchestra...Given that the symphony in 12 movements, summarized the 
    entirety of creation and human life, the homogeneity that was also found in 
    the musical invention was perplexing. &quot;Dedication of Merit&quot;--the 
    last movement, a Buddhist prayer for peace to emanate from virtue--did not 
    sound so different from &quot;The Creation of Sentient Beings&quot; (the fourth 
    movement) or, indeed, from most of the rest. </font>(Compare 2 Peter 3:1-10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moments of difference stood out 
    all the more. One came at the start of the Seventh movement, &quot;Suffering,&quot; 
    where the bass soloist took a theme from the Psalms - &quot;My God, my God, 
    why have you forsaken me?&quot; - and suddenly started to sound as if he meant 
    it...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was another exceptional passage 
    at the start of a setting from the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; in 
    the 10th movement, &quot;Judgment and Apocalypse.&quot; The noisome moral 
    - &quot;That your suffering comes from your own actions; it is not due to 
    anybody else&quot; - was set as a jolly round, which was the only instance 
    of counterpoint in the entire work...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But none of these was the moment 
    that counted. What mattered was that right at the end, with the emphatic conclusion 
    in sight, Mr. Glass drew back, took his music into darker, more chromatic 
    territory, had his choir re-enter in moaning disconsolation, and only then 
    moved toward his close. </font>(And then the critic, deeply unmindful of the 
    meaning of it all, says): <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Irony 
    is not his strong point, but here it seemed that he was, within his own work, 
    undercutting its preposterous pretensions. </font>The New York Times<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    directions without veering as they moved. Their entire bodies...were full 
    of eyes all around.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ezekiel's vision of giant, many-eyed 
    wheels, sliding through space in the company of angels, was part of the stimulus 
    for Mr. Berio's &quot;Ofanim&quot; (the Hebrew word meaning wheels or modes), 
    a big work for voices, instruments and electronics. Now Mr. Berio is taking 
    it to Carnegie Hall, three days before his Oct. 24 birthday, for its American 
    premier...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Mr. Berio and his team, the 
    challenge throughout the last 10 years has been how to realize sounds that 
    would spin and move through space like Ezekiel's wheels. This is the kind 
    of problem (Berio's chief technologist) Giuseppe di Giugno enjoys. He did 
    his doctoral research in the physics of elemental particles...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Berio's composition was sparked, 
    he said, by a visit to the Tower of David in Jerusalem, which gave him &quot;the 
    vision of a complex huge architecture, with many layers and corridors.&quot; 
    These layers and corridors are partly in the substance of the music, in its 
    electronic elaborations of an already elaborate ensemble of children's voices, 
    instrumental groups and, emerging at the end, a lone woman singing from the 
    Song of Songs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there are also layers and corridors 
    of time being evoked here. For his soloist, Mr. Berio wanted a voice &quot;that 
    stayed away from the noble stereotypes of our tradition,&quot; and so he wrote 
    the part for Esti Kenan Ofri, whose usual repertory consists of Arab and Bedouin 
    music. In &quot;Ofanim&quot; she represents the universal mother, and Ezekiel's 
    text is transformed, Mr. Berio said, &quot;to make it more directly related 
    to the present situation.&quot; What results is the image of a mother taken 
    away from her land.</font></p>
