    Soviet influence in Eastern Europe began with Soviet occupation of territories 
    during World War II. By 1949 communist regimes had been put into place in 
    all the occupied states: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic 
    (East Germany), Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Under the leadership of Josip 
    Broz Tito, Yugoslavia maintained an independent position as a communist state 
    that Soviet leaders first vilified but ultimately recognized in 1955. Domination 
    of the East European countries belonging to the Warsaw Pact and the Council 
    for Mutual Economic Assistance (known as Comecon) remained a fundamental priority 
    of Soviet foreign policy through the disintegration of both organizations 
    in 1991. Soviet leaders used the continued existence of socialist regimes 
    in Eastern Europe as part of the ideological justification of socialism at 
    home because it fulfilled the Marxist-Leninist recipe of the rule of the multinational 
    proletariat. Because of that logic, a threat to Eastern Europe became a threat 
    to the Soviet Union itself...</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1950s, the Soviet military used force to restrain mass expressions 
    of resistance to conventional, Soviet-backed regimes in East Germany (1953), 
    Poland (1956), and Hungary (1956). After the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of 
    Czechoslovakia quelled political liberalization in that country, the irreversibility 
    of communist control in East European countries was formulated in what became 
    known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, which for the next twenty years was the foundation 
    of Soviet policy toward the region. Soviet policy makers determined that occupation 
    forces were the only sure guarantee of continued communist rule in Eastern 
    Europe and that some limited local control over domestic policy was necessary 
    to avoid future resistance. When Polish workers pushed their demands for independent 
    trade unions and the right to strike in 1980-81 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(enter 
    Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II into the political equation)</font>, the 
    implicit threat of invasion by Soviet forces led Polish police and security 
    forces to quell disturbances and a new, military prime minister, General Wojciech 
    Jaruzelski, to declare martial law.</p>
  <p>In the mid-1980s, Gorbachev's internal liberalization was paralleled by his 
    doctrine of &quot;many roads to socialism,&quot; which called for cooperation 
    rather than uniformity among East European nations. That call coincided with 
    the implicit revocation in 1988 of the Brezhnev Doctrine as Soviet military 
    doctrine recognized the need to conserve resources (see Soviet Doctrine, ch. 
    9). Gorbachev's internal reform programs of glasnost (see Glossary) and perestroika 
    (see Glossary) received varying degrees of support and imitation among East 
    European leaders. Regimes in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland showed substantial 
    support, but those in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Romania refused to 
    adopt the type of far-reaching domestic reforms that Gorbachev introduced 
    at home (see The Gorbachev Era, ch. 2). Nevertheless, by the late 1980s the 
    nature of Soviet influence had shifted unmistakably away from coercion toward 
    political and economic instruments of influence. The last stage of Soviet 
    relations with the region, 1989-91, was fundamentally different. By 1990 all 
    the East European member states of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon had rejected 
    their communist regimes AND WERE STRAINING TOWARD THE WEST. Although Soviet 
    policy makers struggled to keep the two multinational organizations alive 
    as instruments of influence, events had rendered them moribund before their 
    formal demise in 1991. NOW THE WORLD REDESIGNATED EASTERN EUROPE AS CENTRAL 
    EUROPE, AND THE GREAT WESTERN BUFFER ZONE DISAPPEARED.</p>
  <p>Immediately after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon and the breakup 
    of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations with Central Europe were a relatively 
    low priority of Russian foreign policy. This situation began to change during 
    1992, when many Russian reformists argued that closer ties with the new Central 
    European democracies would bolster Russia's own commitment to democratization. 
    Closer commercial ties also would make Central Europe's relatively inexpensive 
    goods more readily available and afford better opportunities to make valuable 
    connections with Western Europe as the former Warsaw Pact states moved closer 
    to full integration into Europe.</p>
  <p>Russia's January 1993 draft foreign policy concept stressed the importance 
    of Central Europe. The concept proclaimed that the region &quot;falls within 
    the historical sphere of our interests&quot; because it abuts &quot;the belt 
    of sovereign states&quot;--Ukraine, Belarus , Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia, 
    and Estonia--of great interest to Russia. The concept warned against attempts 
    by the West to push Russia out of Central Europe and to make the region into 
    a buffer zone that would isolate Russia from Western Europe. Russia would 
    counter such movements by reestablishing good trade and other relations with 
    the Central European states.</p>
  <p>The NATO Issue<br>
    The draft concept did not present NATO involvement in Central Europe as inherently 
    threatening to Russian interests. Later in 1993, however, Yeltsin reversed 
    course under the political exigency of his upcoming confrontation with the 
    State Duma. The new position was that former members of the Warsaw Pact could 
    join NATO only if Russia also were included. This opposition then spurred 
    the United States proposal of the Partnership for Peace.</p>
  <p>The military doctrine that Yeltsin decreed in November 1993 was not directed 
    clearly at NATO. CALLING FOR A NEUTRAL CENTRAL EUROPE, THE DOCTRINE WARNED 
    THAT RUSSIA WOULD INTERPRET AS A THREAT THE EXPANSION OF ANY ALLIANCE IN EUROPE 
    TO THE DETRIMENT OF RUSSIA' INTERESTS OR THE INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN TROOPS 
    IN STATES ADJACENT TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. Throughout 1995 and the first 
    half of 1996, Russian military officials continued to demand that the Central 
    European states remain neutral. During the Moscow visit of Poland's president 
    Alexander Kwasniewski in April 1996, Yeltsin hailed warmer ties, but he noted 
    that the NATO issue remained the single obstacle over which the two sides 
    disagreed.</p>

<p align="center">THE GRAND CHESSBOARD</p>
<p align="center">Zbigniew Brzezinski's Latest Blueprint For American Foreign 
  Policy</p>
<p align="center">By Bernard Gwertzman</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Of course the Bush 
    administration has its own strategy--Full Force--and is presently moving its 
    pieces in its own way across the board. His pawns and knights [and his bishops 
    at home], having already checkmated one king in the Middle East, are now preparing 
    for the next match. The Great King, however--the grandest Chessmaster of them 
    all--is still hiding behind His own forces, and has yet to loose them out 
    of the North and the East. He is drawing the American pieces out across the 
    Great Chessboard, extending them, entangling them, and will move before the 
    game is over to check and checkmate).</font></p>
  <p>Since the end of the cold war and the collapse of Communism, the United States 
    has accepted the &quot;victory&quot; and, for better or worse, has had collective 
    amnesia about global issues. After some 50 years during which foreign affairs 
    commanded the highest priority in Washington and on television and the front 
    page, the subject has virtually disappeared for most Americans...</p>
  <p>(And this was true in a sense, until September 11th, 2001. Nevertheless the 
    neo-cons of the Reagan-Bush administrations were not asleep at their posts 
    during the Clinton years, AND WERE CLEVERLY DEVISING AND INCITING THE VERY 
    GLOBAL STRATEGY THAT IS UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES AT THIS PRESENT TIME).</p>
  <p>This is true from top to bottom. President Clinton clearly pays as little 
    attention to foreign affairs as he can get away with...For many in the foreign 
    policy establishment, this means the public cares less and less about what 
    they have to say. But they keep saying it anyway. And some are saying with 
    increasing alarm: Wake up, America, before its too late.</p>
  <p>One of those most troubled by the sudden turn in American attitudes is Zbigniew 
    Brzezinski, who from 1977 to 1981 was President Jimmy Carter's national security 
    advisor, and who has for years been one of the more provocative thinkers about 
    foreign affairs, PARTICULARLY THOSE DEALING WITH THE FORMER SOVIET BLOC. What 
    has bothered Brzezinski is that as a result of the Soviet collapse, THE UNITED 
    STATES IS THE UNQUESTIONABLE WORLD LEADER, UNCHALLENGED FOR THE MOMENT BY 
    ANY OTHER POWER. But American democracy does not lend itself well to the running 
    of empires. This has frustrated Brzezinski, who has now provided another scholarly 
    blueprint for what he believes the United States should do in the coming years 
    to further American interests, maintain the hegemony it commands and prevent 
    global anarchy. For Brzezinski this is a strategic game, not unlike chess, 
    TO OUTWIT POTENTIAL RIVALS, and hence the title of the book: <i>The Grand 
    Chessboard</i>....</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1"><i>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord 
      shall have them in derision.</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex 
      them in His sore displeasure</font></i> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Recall 
      that Brzezinski's grand strategy was laid down well before September 11th...Deuteronomy 
      32:16-22; Isaiah 30:25. KJV)</font><font size="+1">...(Psalm 2:4,5)</font>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is not the first time Brzezinski has touched on this theme. Eleven years 
    ago he published &quot;THE GAME PLAN: A GEOSTRATIGIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONDUCT 
    OF THE U.S.-SOVIET CONTEST.&quot; And just four years ago, in the aftermath 
    of the Soviet disintegration, he wrote: &quot;Out of Control: Global Turmoil 
    on the Eve of the Twenty-first Century,&quot; which many saw as a counter 
    to the optimistic view of the future in &quot;The End of History and the Last 
    Man,&quot; by Francis Fukuyama...</p>
  <p>Brzezinski, who writes convincingly if a bit inelegantly, describes a very 
    forbidding situation in the years ahead if the United States does not make 
    more permanent the dominance it now has over a vast area of the world. &quot;This 
    huge oddly-shaped Eurasian chessboard--extending from Lisbon to Vladivostok--provides 
    the setting for the game,&quot; Brzezinski says. &quot;IF THE MIDDLE SPACE 
    CAN BE DRAWN INCREASINGLY INTO THE EXPANDING ORBIT OF THE WEST (where America 
    preponderates), if the southern region is not subjected to domination by a 
    single player, and if the East is not unified in a manner that leads to the 
    expulsion of America from its offshore bases, AMERICA CAN THEN BE SAID TO 
    PREVAIL...</p>
  <p>He concludes bluntly that &quot;the time has come for the United States to 
    formulate and prosecute an integrated, comprehensive and long-term geostrategy 
    FOR ALL OF EURASIA...</p>
  <p>How the United States manages this chessboard , he says, &quot;will be critical 
    to the longevity and stability of America's global primacy.&quot;...&quot;In 
    brief,&quot; he writes, &quot;the U.S. policy goal must be unapologetically 
    twofold: to perpetuate America's own dominant position...and to create a geopolitical 
    framework that can absorb the inevitable shocks and strains of social-political 
    change while evolving into the geopolitical core of shared responsibility 
    for peaceful global management.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New

  NATO BOOSTS ITS ARSENAL FOR POLITICAL ENDS</p>
<p align="center">By Michael Evans</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>November 20, 2002__NATO will boost its firepower at its summit in Prague tomorrow, 
    with 13,000 more tanks, a dozen warships and 500 combat aircraft. Its total 
    number of troops will rise by about 227,000. The alliance has little use for 
    all this extra muscle, however. Much of it is old Soviet hardware that has 
    about as much relevance for today&#146;s new threats as a troop of elephants 
    in modern expeditionary warfare. The forces will be provided by the seven 
    former Communist countries that will be invited to join Nato &#151; Slovakia, 
    Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia &#151; bringing 
    its membership to 26. </p>
  <p>This latest expansion is driven primarily by political, not military, considerations. 
    It is about embracing as many Eastern European countries as possible in the 
    hope of spreading Western values. As Condoleezza Rice, President Bush&#146;s 
    National Security Adviser, put it: &#147;THIS IS A SUMMIT THAT IS GOING TO 
    CELEBRATE AN HISTORIC MOMENT FOR NATO, WHICH IS THE EXPANSION OF NATO INTO 
    TERRITORIES THAT I THINK NOBODY EVER THOUGHT NATO WOULD EXPAND INTO.&#148; 
  </p>
  <p>Nato has always been part-military and part-political, but with 26 members, 
    each with the right of veto, it will become more of a political organisation 
    than ever before, with plenty of scope for jaw-jaw, not war-war. As Andrew 
    Brookes, of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, 
    said yesterday: &#147;The bases in the Baltic countries would be very useful 
    if Nato was about to wage war against Sweden, but . . .&#148; </p>
  <p>The seven new countries are very much second division. Those that have tanks 
    are still armed principally with ancient Russian T55s and their air forces 
    consist largely of old-generation MiG21s and MiG23s. Even the first-division 
    ex-Warsaw Pact countries that were invited to join Nato in 1999 &#151; Hungary, 
    Poland and the Czech Republic &#151; are still struggling to meet the standards 
    required, let alone full inter-operability with the big guns of Nato. &#147;You 
    don&#146;t meet the requirements. You don&#146;t do what you are supposed 
    to,&#148; Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, the Nato Secretary-General, told Hungary&#146;s 
    chastened Defence Minister earlier this year. Lacking modern warplanes of 
    their own, the Czechs have had to invite the United States to provide F15s 
    and F16s to protect the summit. </p>
  <p>Nato veterans recognise that the alliance is not about to acquire seven modern 
    fighting armies. They talk of the importance of new entrants providing &#147;niche&#148; 
    capabilities: the bomb disposal expertise of the three Baltic countries, Bulgaria&#146;s 
    decontamination team and Romania&#146;s mountain-trained special forces. Even 
    the Russians now realise that this Nato expansion, which will extend the alliance 
    to its borders, is not about creating an ever more threatening military empire 
    BUT IS A WAY OF GUARANTEEING A POLITICAL STABILITY THROUGHOUT EUROPE. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(In 
    other words, conquest)</font>.</p>
  <p>The three Baltic states will accept Nato membership tomorrow WITHOUT A MURMUR 
    FROM MOSCOW'S TOP BRASS. Russia&#146;s Foreign Minister will attend the summit 
    and later Mr Bush will meet President Putin in St Petersburg. </p>
  <p>This is all a far cry from Nato&#146;s original purpose, WHICH WAS TO GUARANTEE 
    A DEFENSIVE WALL AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION, WITH THE FIGHTING MOTTO: ALL FOR 
    ONE, AND ONE FOR ALL. THE NEW POLICY OF EXPANSION HAS OBVIOUS DANGERS. Already 
    Nato is struggling to transform itself into a modern, rapidly deployable organisation 
    capable of meeting 21st-century threats, even without the addition of new 
    members drawn from the old Soviet mould. </p>
  <p>Nato operates on consensus, but consensus may be much harder to obtain with 
    26 increasingly disparate members. There is also a danger of conflicts erupting 
    within Nato&#146;s new borders. Huge efforts will be required to achieve military 
    inter-operability throughout the alliance, and there could be some big embarrassments 
    down the line. Only last week Bulgaria&#146;s Defence Minister offered to 
    resign over a state-owned company&#146;s illegal export of military components 
    to Syria, which is often a conduit for goods destined for Iraq. </p>
  <p>DESPITE THOSE DANGERS, NATO'S DOOR IS OPEN TO EVEN MORE MEMBERS. Next in 
    line to join are the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Croatia, Ukraine 
    and even Albania &#151; some of which make Romania and Bulgaria seem MODELS 
    OF ENLIGHTENMENT.</p>

<p align="center">MONDAY, FEB. 9, 2004 SAFIRE WARNS OF PUTIN'S 'CREEPING COUP'</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Echoes of the Cold War resounded this weekend in Munich during NATO's annual 
    security conference when Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Ivanov went head-to-head 
    with Sen. John McCain and more than met his match.</p>
  <p>New York Times columnist William Safire wrote today that Munich, the site 
    of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's shameful appeasement of Adolf 
    Hitler, was no longer &quot;a venue of appeasement,&quot; largely thanks to 
    McCain, who called Ivanov's bluff when the Russian foreign minister threatened 
    to back out of an agreement limiting his nation's armed forces on the European 
    front. </p>
  <p>McCain, R-Ariz., accused Putin's regime of a &quot;creeping coup&quot; against 
    freedom within his own country and of waging a campaign &quot;to intimidate 
    and reassert control over states &#151; from the Baltics to Belarus, Georgia 
    and Ukraine &#151; that our victory in the Cold War had liberated from Soviet 
    rule.&quot; Unspoken during the arguments is Russia's resentment of NATO's 
    addition soon of seven members, some bordering on Russia. According to Safire, 
    recent developments fostering Russian enmity toward NATO include:</p>
  <p>Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit last month to to the former Soviet 
    republic of Georgia to attend the inauguration of that nation's new elected 
    leader. Moreover, his visit was accompanied by the publishing of an article 
    by Powell in Izvestia uncommonly critical of Moscow's repression of the media.</p>
  <p>McCain's visit to Latvia at the head of a congressional delegation, where 
    he heard of a recent gathering in the Baltic states with Scandinavian nations 
    to focus on internal opposition to tyrants such as Aleksandr Lukashenko of 
    Belarus and the former KGB crowd that runs Moldova. In Munich, Ivanov unloaded 
    on the West, focusing on the decade-old C0NVENTIONAL FORCES IN EUROPE TREATY, 
    initialed but never signed. &quot;In 1996,&quot; Safire recalled, &quot;as 
    NATO prepared to admit Eastern Europe, it set up a formal relationship with 
    Russia, assuring it that no nukes and no 'substantial combat forces' would 
    be placed close to its border. Three years later, Russia made the 'Istanbul 
    commitments' to pull its troops out of Georgia and Moldova, which it still 
    has not done. Looking hard at McCain, Ivanov said, &quot;One of the major 
    priorities of the Russian foreign policy is our relationship with our closest 
    neighbors ... relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States are in 
    no way a hallmark of Russian-brand 'neo-imperialism,' as some try to depict

  PUTIN'S 'CREEPING COUP'</p>
<p align="center">By WILLIAM SAFIRE</p>
<p align="center">February 9, 2004</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>MUNICH &#151; This city is no longer the venue of appeasement. At an annual 
    security conference here on the eve of NATO's seven-state expansion, Moscow's 
    neo-imperialist defense minister threatened to back out of an agreement limiting 
    the size of his armed forces on Russia's European front. </p>
  <p>Sergei Ivanov's bluff was immediately called by U.S. Senator John McCain. 
    The Arizonan had accused Putin's regime of a &quot;creeping coup&quot; against 
    democracy within Russia, as well as a campaign to intimidate and reassert 
    control over states &#151; from the Baltics to Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine 
    &#151; that our victory in the cold war had liberated from Soviet rule.</p>
  <p>This Russia-NATO confrontation has been brewing for a year. While France 
    and Germany split with the rest of Europe and the U.S. over the war in Iraq, 
    Putin took advantage of the world's distraction to crack down on internal 
    dissent and to undermine the independence of his neighbors.</p>
  <p>The first public inkling of U.S. concern with Putin's irredentism came in 
    Secretary Colin Powell's trip last month to attend the inauguration of Georgia's 
    new elected leader, signaling strong support for that nation's independence. 
    This was accompanied by a Powell article in Izvestia uncommonly critical of 
    Moscow's repression of the media.</p>
  <p>Western reaction to Russia's new aggressiveness was further expressed last 
    week in Riga, Latvia. The Baltics' surge toward independence in 1989 was the 
    first sign of the impending crack-up of the Soviet Union. The West's coming 
    inclusion of those three states in NATO redresses a horrific Hitler-Stalin 
    wrong, but is galling to Moscow, which has been fostering resentment among 
    Russian ethnics implanted there since Stalin's time. </p>
  <p>In Latvia's capital, the Baltic states gathered with Scandinavian nations 
    to focus European human-rights attention on internal democratic opposition 
    to outright tyrants like Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus and the former K.G.B. 
    crowd that runs Moldova. Though Ukraine gave up its nukes and has 1,700 troops 
    in Iraq, it has an autocratic ruler in Leonid Kuchma, reportedly rigging its 
    fall elections. McCain led a Congressional delegation to this Riga meeting 
    on his way to Munich and heard the anguished story of a dissident Belarus 
    leader whose husband is one of the &quot;disappeared.&quot;</p>
  <p>At the 40th Wehrkunde Conference in Munich, Ivanov unloaded on the West. 
    The pressure point he chose was the Conventional Forces in Europe (C.F.E.) 
    treaty, negotiated a decade ago, initialed but never signed. In 1996, as NATO 
    prepared to admit Eastern Europe, it set up a formal relationship with Russia, 
    assuring it that no nukes and no &quot;substantial combat forces&quot; would 
    be placed close to its border. Three years later, Russia made the &quot;Istanbul 
    commitments&quot; to pull its troops out of Georgia and Moldova, which it 
    still has not done. </p>
  <p>&quot;We assumed those commitments in a definite military and political environment,&quot; 
    Ivanov warned, &quot;with the admission of the invitees to NATO, this environment 
    will drastically change.&quot; Of the C.F.E. treaty, he asked: &quot;Might 
    it be another `relic of the cold war,' as the ABM treaty has been labeled 
    some time ago&quot; before it was &quot;shelved to the dustbin&quot;? He made 
    Putin's threat plainer: &quot;The adapted C.F.E. treaty may well end up as 
    the ABM treaty was fated to.&quot;</p>
  <p>Looking hard at McCain, Ivanov said, &quot;One of the major priorities of 
    the Russian foreign policy is our relationship with our closest neighbors 
    . . . relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States are in no way 
    a hallmark of Russian-brand `neo-imperialism,' as some try to depict it, but 
    an imperative for security. . . .&quot;</p>
  <p>McCain is no Neville Chamberlain. &quot;Under President Putin,&quot; he responded, 
    &quot;Russia has refused to comply with the terms of the Treaty on Conventional 
    Forces in Europe. Russian troops occupy parts of Georgia and Moldova . . . 
    Russian agents are working to bring Ukraine further into Moscow's orbit. Russian 
    support sustains Europe's last dictatorship in Belarus. And Moscow has . . 
    . enforced its stranglehold on energy supplies into Latvia in order to squeeze 
    the democratic government in Riga.&quot;</p>
  <p>Speaking with the freedom of a senator, McCain said &quot;undemocratic behavior 
    and threats to the sovereignty and liberty of her neighbors will not profit 
    Russia . . . but will exclude her from the company of Western democracies.&quot;</p>
  <p>As its role becomes global, NATO must not lose its original purpose: to contain 
    the Russian bear. </p>

<p align="center"> Ivanov Says Russia May Pull Out of Arms Treaty</p>
<p align="center">Tuesday, February 10, 2004 </p>
<p align="center">By Greg Walters</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Special to The Moscow Times Russia may abandon a security treaty limiting 
    conventional weapons and troop deployments in Europe, Defense Minister Sergei 
    Ivanov said at an international security conference in Munich on Monday, unless 
    it is changed to rule out NATO forces in the Baltic states.</p>
  <p>Ivanov protested that the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, negotiated 
    in the 1980s between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw 
    Pact, does not include Baltic countries, which are scheduled to become NATO 
    members in April. &quot;With NATO enlargement, they start operating in the 
    zone of vitally important interests of our country,&quot; Ivanov said, The 
    Associated Press reported. &quot;They should -- in deed, not only in words 
    -- take into account Russian concerns.&quot; IVANOV'S COMMENTS COME AS THE 
    UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERING A WIDE-RANGING REORGANIZATION OF ITS FORCES BASED 
    IN EUROPE. </p>
  <p>Talks between Russia and NATO have broken down in recent years over an updated 
    version of the CFE, which reworked the treaty to take the collapse of the 
    Soviet Union into account. Europe and the United States have protested Russia's 
    reluctance to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova, despite commitments 
    made by Moscow when the treaty was updated in 1999. Since then, Russia has 
    repeatedly delayed ratification of the new version of the treaty. On Monday, 
    Ivanov said the CFE could become a relic of the Cold War.</p>
  <p>Speaking at the conference, U.S. Senator John McCain said, &quot;Undemocratic 
    behavior and threats to the sovereignty and liberty of her neighbors will 
    not profit Russia -- but will exclude her from the company of Western democracies,&quot; 
    The New York Times reported.</p>
  <p>Independent military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Monday that despite Ivanov's 
    rhetoric, Russia is not likely to unilaterally pull out of the treaty. &quot;This 
    will not bring Russia any kind of gain,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no real 
    need for withdrawal, just to make some noise.&quot; But in its current form, 
    the treaty appears to be unworkable, Felgenhauer said. &quot;Russia is clamoring 
    for ratification of the treaty to happen, and the Baltic states to be included,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;But the West says Russia must first withdraw from Georgia and 
    Moldova.&quot;</p>
  <p>The Baltic countries' exclusion from the CFE means that, in theory, NATO 
    could mass any amount of troops and weaponry there when those countries join 
    the alliance. But Felgenhauer said such an action would be highly unlikely. 
    Both NATO and Russia maintain forces well below the treaty's limits.</p>
  <p>On Monday, Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius told The Associated 
    Press that there are no &quot;concrete plans&quot; to set up NATO bases in 
    Lithuania, but also said, &quot;It's not excluded in the future.&quot;</p>

  PUTIN LAMENTS DEATH OF THE SOVIET UNION<br>
  By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>February 12, 2004<br>
    <br>
    MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin used a campaign speech Thursday to 
    declare the demise of the Soviet Union a ``national tragedy on an enormous 
    scale,'' in what appeared to be his strongest-ever lament of the collapse 
    of the Soviet empire.</p>
  <p>Putin, a former agent of the Soviet KGB spy agency, has praised aspects of 
    the Soviet Union in the past but never so robustly nor in such an important 
    political setting. ``The breakup of the Soviet Union is a national tragedy 
    on an enormous scale,'' from which ``only the elites and nationalists of the 
    republics gained,'' Putin said in a nationally televised speech to about 300 
    campaign workers gathered at Moscow State University. The president's language 
    was sure to send a chill through the 14 other former Soviet republics that 
    have been independent from Moscow rule for more than a decade.</p>
  <p>In the past and to audiences from the former republics, Putin has sought 
    to ease fears about Russia having designs on rebuilding the old empire. In 
    September remarks after a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
    -- the grouping of former Soviet republics -- Putin said: ``The Soviet Union 
    (was) a very complicated page in the history of our people,'' adding ``that 
    train has left.''</p>
  <p>But on Thursday, he spoke in a much stronger tone, appearing to play to Russian 
    nationalism. ``I think that ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and 
    the post-Soviet space gained nothing from this. On the contrary, people have 
    faced a huge number of problems,'' he said. ``Today we must look at the reality 
    we live in. We cannot only look back and curse about this issue. We must look 
    forward,'' he said.</p>
  <p>Across town, meanwhile, Putin challengers in the election next month refused 
    to debate among themselves in a television program called for that purpose. 
    The candidates said a debate was meaningless without Putin, who says he doesn't 
    need the free television advertising. At the taping of what was to be the 
    first debate ahead of the March 14 vote, four of Putin's six challengers answered 
    questions from the studio audience, but then rejected the host's appeal that 
    they debate each other.</p>
  <p>``Bring Vladimir Putin here and we will have a debate,'' independent liberal 
    candidate Irina Khakamada said, winning applause from the audience. Calling 
    it pointless to debate with anyone but Putin, ``my main competitor'', Communist 
    candidate Nikolai Kharitonov said that by ignoring the debates, ``Putin is 
    depriving the population of the right to choose.'' Also at the taping were 
    candidates Sergei Glazyev of the populist-nationalist Homeland Party and Oleg 
    Malyshkin of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
  <p>Regardless of Putin's public declarations about campaign advertising, state-controlled 
    television channels already lavish him with extensive coverage -- as on Thursday 
    when state-run Rossiya showed his remarks live. Addressing a packed auditorium 
    at Moscow State University, Putin said: ``The head of state should not engage 
    in self-advertising.''</p>
  <p>``Nevertheless,'' he continued, ``I am simply obliged before my voters and 
    the entire country to account for what has been done during the past four 
    years, and to tell people what I intend to do during the next four years.''</p>
  <p>Responding to a question after his state-of-the-nation-style speech, Putin 
    said that the 1991 Soviet collapse -- which most Russians regret -- led to 
    few gains and many problems for ordinary citizens.</p>
  <p>Turning to global politics, Putin said that Russia must become a ``full-fledged 
    member of the world community'' and assailed those in the West who still have 
    a Cold War-era distrust of Russia. They ``can't get out of the freezer,'' 
    he said. Putin reiterated his stated opposition to prolonging his time in 
    office, limited to two terms. But he indicated he would choose a preferred 
    successor, saying that the task of any top leader ``is to propose to society 
    a person he considers worthy to work further in this position.''</p>
  <p>Some Putin opponents had considered boycotting the presidential election, 
    saying a fair vote was impossible in Russia today, and the refusal to debate 
    in Thursday's program reflected the candidates' anger at the president's dominance 
    of the campaign. Some political analysts said, however, the public does not 
    expect Putin to debate. ``They see the head of state as a monarch who shouldn't 
    participate in discussions with those below him in the hierarchy,'' said Andrei 
    Ryabov of the Carnegie Institute in Moscow said.</p>
  <p>The Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe said the state-controlled 
    media's parliamentary campaign coverage was slanted toward pro-Putin forces 
    and accused the government of pressuring news media, to limit opposition views.</p>

  <p>Both your Feb. 9 editorial &quot;Soul Gazing&quot; (some editions) and William

    the changes in Russia's domestic and foreign policies &#151; from the manipulation

    Forces in Europe treaty, portending a less pro-Western stance on any number

  <p>Nonetheless, some of the blame for these changes rests squarely with the 
    Bush administration. President Vladimir V. Putin took a risk &#151; over the 
    objections of many of his advisers &#151; when immediately after 9/11 he joined 
    in the fight against terrorism by allowing the deployment of American troops 
    in Central Asia. </p>
  <p>And what did Russia get in return? The United States repaid Mr. Putin by 
    abrogating the Antiballistic Missile treaty and by pushing NATO expansion

<p align="center">BUSH WELCOMES SEVEN NEW NATO MEMBERS</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Washington, 29 March 2004 (RFE/RL) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
    has formally accepted seven new nations into the military alliance, extending 
    NATO's frontiers to the Russian border and holding out the possibility for 
    further expansion.</p>
  <p>At a White House ceremony on 29 March, U.S. President George W. Bush welcomed 
    the former communist nations into NATO. Bush was joined by the prime ministers 
    of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. 
    These countries submitted accession documents to U.S. Secretary of State Colin 
    Powell during a ceremony in Washington earlier today. </p>
  <p>RECALLING THE COLD WAR-ERA DOMINATION BY THE SOVIET UNION OF ITS ALLIES, 
    BUSH SAID: &quot;THE PEOPLE OF THESE SEVEN NATIONS WERE CAPTIVE TO AN EMPIRE. 
    They endured bitter tyranny. They struggled for independence. THEY EARNED 
    THEIR FREEDOM THROUGH COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE AND TODAY THEY STAND WITH US 
    as full and equal partners in this great alliance.&quot; </p>
  <p>The acceptance of the seven countries increased the members in the alliance 
    to 26. Under the treaty, they are bound to defend each other militarily if 
    one of them comes under attack. The new members will participate in their 
    first meeting on 2 April in Brussels, Belgium, at NATO headquarters. Three 
    other nations -- Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia -- hope to join at a future 
    date. </p>
  <p>BUSH SAID THE DOOR TO NATO WILL REMAIN OPEN &quot;UNTIL THE WHOLE OF EUROPE 
    IS UNITED IN FREEDOM AND PEACE.&quot; The president said the seven new members 
    will strengthen the alliance. &quot;Our new members bring moral clarity to 
    the purposes of our alliance. They understand our cause in Afghanistan and 
    in Iraq because tyranny for them is still a fresh memory,&quot; Bush said. 
    &quot;These nations know that when great democracies fail to confront danger 
    far worse peril can follow.&quot; </p>
  <p>NATO, said Bush, now has a new greater mission: to fight against international 
    terrorism. &quot;Today our alliance faces a new enemy which has brought death 
    to innocent people from New York to Madrid,&quot; he said. &quot;Terrorists 
    hate everything this alliance stands for. They despise our freedom. They fear 
    our unity. They seek to divide us. They will fail. We will not be divided.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>The president said that even before formally joining the alliance, the seven 
    countries were undertaking vital missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;Bulgaria 
    provided refueling facilities during the early days of Operation Enduring 
    Freedom and has deployed more than 400 soldiers to Iraq. Military engineers 
    from Estonia and Latvia are helping to clear explosive devices from Iraq. 
    Forces from Lithuania and Slovakia are helping to secure Iraq. Romanian troops 
    have sacrificed their lives fighting terrorists in Afghanistan,&quot; Bush 
    said. </p>
  <p>NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said RUSSIA -- AN OPPONANT OF 
    THE ENLARGEMENT -- should not be worried. De Hoop Scheffer said he believes 
    Russia understands an expanded NATO has no designs against Moscow. He said 
    NATO has a solid relationship with Russia and intends to build on it. </p>
  <p>BUT RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN ALEKSANDR YAKOVENKO AGAIN VOICED HIS 
    GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTION, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANI 
    JOINING THE ALIIANCE. &quot;BY ADMITTING THE BALTIC COUNTRIES AND OFFERING 
    THEM SECURITY GUARANTEES, MANY NATO COUNTRIES APPARENTLY PROCEED FROM THE 
    OLD CONCEPT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A WAR IN EUROPE,&quot; HE SAID. &quot;Only 
    this logic explains the inclusion of the Baltic states in the alliance's integrated 
    air-defense system, the recent AWACS [NATO's Airborne Warning and Control 
    radar aircraft] flights, and the construction of new military facilities near 
    our borders.&quot; </p>
  <p>Earlier today, Sergei Mironov, speaker of Russia's Federation Council, the 
    upper chamber of parliament, also reiterated Moscow's opposition to NATO expansion. 
    MIRONOV SAID THE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES ARE IN A STATE OF CONTINUAL BATTLE READINESS 
    AND WILL &quot;TRACK THE SITUATION THAT IS DEVELOPING AT OUR BORDERS OWING 
    TO THE EXPANSION.&quot; </p>
  <p>The alliance was originally set up by the West to counter the Soviet Union's 
    military might. NATO was established on 4 April 1949 by 12 nations: Belgium, 
    Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, 
    Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. During the Cold War, 
    the alliance grew to include West Germany, Greece, Spain, and Turkey. After 
    the Cold War ended, three former members of the once-rival Warsaw Pact joined 
    NATO -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. <br>

  'WHOLE AND FREE' AT LAST <br>
  America Has Second Thoughts About a United Europe<br>
  By ROGER COHEN</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    WASHINGTON, May 2, 2004&#151; The expansion of the European Union this weekend 
    from 15 members to 25, marking the formal end of Europe's postwar division, 
    presents America with a choice. Should it embrace this new union that stretches 
    to the Russian border or try to foster Europe's many fissures in order to 
    divide and rule? </p>
  <p>For the moment, there is scant official comment, but perhaps Europe should 
    not take this personally. The United States has shifted paradigms: Europe 
    is old news. Still, the less-than-benign neglect surrounding the European 
    Union's addition of 10 members, 8 of them once part of the Soviet bloc, reflects 
    a moment of great difficulty.</p>
  <p>&quot;The situation has never been so bad in 50 years,&quot; Gunter Burghardt, 
    the union's ambassador in Washington, said in an interview. &quot;It is a 
    fact of life that America is a hegemonic power, but the question is how that 
    power is used. We need to know that America is open to a confident relationship, 
    not just with certain member states but with the E.U. as such.&quot;</p>
  <p>This assessment reflects the enduring wounds of the Iraq war and the feeling 
    among many European officials that an American administration has determined 
    that its interests may lie more in division within Europe than in unity, more 
    in forging improvised coalitions of the willing than in honoring a partnership 
    of the wedded.</p>
  <p>&quot;This is an administration that simply does not care about Europe,&quot; 
    said Philip H. Gordon, an expert on European affairs at the Brookings Institution. 
    &quot;I don't think they do anything solely to divide Europe, but if that's 
    a consequence of an action, fine, because they don't want a counterweight 
    to American power emerging.&quot;</p>
  <p>In many respects, the new European Union is a potential major power. Its 
    highly educated population of 455 million people is far larger than America's 
    and it accounts for 28 percent of world trade. But it is also divided between 
    formerly Communist states in Central Europe that are enthusiastic about Atlanticism, 
    and other countries, led by France, where dislike of President Bush's America 
    is intense. This is the basic ideological split that America could choose 
    to quicken or quiet.</p>
  <p>America might, for example, try to use the sympathies of Poland, Slovakia 
    or Hungary to undermine European unity and pursue its own goals, which may 
    include the establishment of military bases in at least one of these countries, 
    quiet attempts to assure that Europe's military identity remains muted or 
    the obstruction of moves toward a more federal United States of Europe. But 
    Iraq has been a sobering experience, and American officials seem, for now, 
    to have dropped talk of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; Europe in favor 
    of a rediscovered pragmatism. &quot;Whatever the differences over the past 
    year, we know that a Europe that is open, at peace, broadly united and reaching 
    out toward Turkey is in the American interest,&quot; one State Department 
    official said.</p>
  <p>The mention of Turkey is significant. Faced by the union's expansion, many 
    Americans respond by asking why Turkey is not included. The question, of course, 
    reflects America's shift from a focus on uniting Europe to the overriding 
    quest to change the Middle East. Admitting Turkey, a Muslim country, to a 
    core institution of the West like the European Union would, in the American 
    view, provide an important example of bridge building to the Islamic world. 
    It is therefore vital, American officials argue, that the union decide at 
    the end of this year to begin negotiations on membership.</p>
  <p>But the impatience over bringing Turkey into Europe also betrays enduring 
    American misunderstanding over the nature of the European Union. The immense 
    complexity and cost of offering membership to a country as big and poor as 
    Turkey are not widely appreciated here. The extent of integration within the 
    union, and the surrender of sovereignty involved, are blurry ideas in America, 
    perhaps because the notion of such transnational merging is anathema to a 
    country at or close to the apogee of its power. If America, Mexico and Canada 
    were as integrated as Europe's states, it would be possible to have a Mexican 
    in Ottawa setting United States interest rates. But that, of course, is unthinkable.</p>
  <p>This European indivisibility, despite all the continent's difficulties, makes 
    it inevitable that new members like Poland will tend to seek shared European 
    positions, whatever their strong American sympathies. At the same time, these 
    institutional differences complicate trans-Atlantic understanding because 
    a sovereign America run by an administration for which power is the coin of 
    the realm faces European states that have put their faith in international 
    institutions like the European Union OR THE UNITED NATIONS or an international 
    criminal court.</p>
  <p>But a lot is at stake in trying to overcome the current crisis of confidence. 
    Between them, the European Union and the United States account for 40 percent 
    of world trade. They are each other's largest trading partners. Business transactions 
    between them run at close to $3 billion a day. This web of economic interests 
    is so rich that it tends to compel a quest to resolve differences and harmonize 
    regulations. The problem is that, in the strategic area, the common purpose 
    that long drove America's broad support of European unity - delivering stability 
    to a continent with a debilitating penchant for war - has been lost.</p>
  <p>It is not delight but some dismay that is accompanying the arrival of the 
    Europe &quot;whole and free&quot; sought by the elder George Bush and reiterated 
    as an objective by President Bush, who said in Warsaw in June 2001 that &quot;our 
    goal is to erase the false lines that have divided Europe for too long.&quot;</p>
  <p>Europe has worked hard on eliminating those divisions. But Mr. Burghardt 
    believes recognition of this is scant in an America whose attention has moved 
    elsewhere.&quot;The E.U. delivered on Nov. 9, that is the fall of the Berlin 
    Wall,&quot; he said. &quot;But we got hit by the geopolitical earthquake of 
    Sept. 11.&quot; In other words, 9/11 trumped 11/9.</p>
  <p>In his Warsaw speech three months before Sept. 11, President Bush also said 
    something else: &quot;When Europe and America are divided, history tends to 
    tragedy.&quot;</p>
