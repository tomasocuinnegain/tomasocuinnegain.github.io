<p><font size="+1">The dispute: Jesus was God, but not man. Jesus was man, but 
  not God. Jesus was both God and man. The reality: Jesus never existed as one 
  <u>single</u> individual alone, but is, instead, the perfect revelation of the 
  <i>Logos</i>, the <i>Word </i>(the Wisdom of this Universe), God's manifestation 
  of Themselves in all things, throughout all times, and in every living being. 
  It is Christ-conscious individuals--such as John the Baptist, Paul, and all 
  the adepts of the early Church in their time, as well as those who are coming 
  to spiritual perfection in our own time--who come to the realization of these 
  things. (Revelation 2:17...KJV). It is understood in the Vedic precept: <i>Brahmin

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">To comprehend the mysteries of Christianity it is first of 
  all essential to distinguish between John's baptism and Paul's. John saw the 
  Metatron, the terrible Angel of Divine Presence, while Paul looked into the 
  same oracles and saw Christ Crucified (Acts 18:24 to 19:5...KJV). And then to 
  realize how these two visions compliment each other, how they are essential 
  to each other and how they were personified in the literary and corporate efforts 
  of the early Church. These adepts could see the Angel of Divine Presence (YHVH--the 
  Invisible Glory of God) risen up everywhere in all the powers of the earth...(Understand 
  Bhagavad Gita. Understand the realities of the 20th, and now the 21st centuries). 
  They realized the Angel's literary as well as historic relationship to the figure 
  of YHShWH (Jehoshua), the captain of the hosts of Israel (Joshua 5:13-15), and 
  to the epic role that the higher Israel would play among the nations of the 
  earth in the last days. This was John's baptism. (Please see Chapter 6):</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mention of the Essene hopes 
    of a New Age of glory leads us naturally to some comments on the special theological 
    views of the Essenes that informed their understanding of history and gave 
    to their community its peculiar institutions. The Essenes belong in the center 
    of that movement (known as) apocalypticism. THE LATER VISIONARIES of the Old 
    Testament, notably the author of Daniel, as well as the later Baptist and 
    Christian communities, DISCOVERED THEMSELVES TO BE LIVING IN THE LAST DAYS 
    OF THE OLD AGE, or rather IN THE DAYS WHEN THE OLD AGE WAS PASSING AWAY AND 
    THE KINGDOM OF GOD WAS DAWNING. According to apocalypticism, THE UPSURGE OF 
    EVIL POWERS IN THE WORLD REFLECTED THE LAST DEFIANT OUTBREAK OF COSMIC SATANIC 
    POWERS. The gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest in the community of the faithful, 
    adumbrated the age of the Spirit TO FOLLOW THE FINAL WAR IN WHICH THE SPIRIT 
    OF TRUTH AND HIS HEAVENLY ARMIES WOULD PUT AN END TO THE RULE OF THE POWERS 
    OF DARKNESS. The constitution of the Essene community was a crystallized apocalyptic 
    vision. Each institution and practise of the community was a preparation for 
    or, by anticipation, a realization of, life in the New Age of God's rule. 
    ON THE ONE HAND, THEIR COMMUNAL LIFE WAS A REENACTMENT OF THE EVENTS OF THE 
    END TIMES, both the final days of the Old Age AND the era of Armegeddon. </font>(An 
    understanding that is reflected everywhere in the Gospel narratives)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    On the other hand, their community, being heirs of the kingdom, participated 
    already in the gifts and glories that were the first fruits of the Age to 
    come. FOR THE APOCALYPTICISTS OF QUMRAN THE KEY TO THESE FUTURE MYSTERIES 
    WAS AT HAND. ONE HAD ONLY TO READ BIBLICAL PROPHECIES WITH THE UNDERSTANDING 
    GIVEN THE INSPIRED INTERPRETER (that is, one who reads with the power of the 
    Holy Spirit) BECAUSE THE SECRETS OF EVENTS TO COME IN THE LAST DAYS WERE FORETOLD 
    BY GOD THROUGH THE MOUTH OF THE HOLY PROPHETS…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In apocalyptic exegesis, three 
    principles should be kept in mind. Prophecy openly or cryptically refers to 
    the last days. Second, the so-called last days are in fact (in types and figures) 
    the present, the days of the sect's life. And finally, the history of ancient 
    Israel's redemption, her offices and institutions, are prototypes of the events 
    and figures of the New Israel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this basis, the Essene camp 
    in the wilderness found its prototype in the Mosaic camp of Numbers (Numbers 
    2 to 4; 9:15-10:28). The Essenes retired to Qumran to 'prepare the way of 
    the Lord' in the wilderness. As God established His ancient covenant in the 
    desert, so the Essenes entered into a New Covenant on their return to the 
    desert. As Israel in the desert was mustered into army ranks in preparation 
    for the Holy War of Conquest, so the Essenes marshaled their community in 
    battle array and wrote liturgies of the Holy Warfare of Armageddon.&quot;

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The preceding verses, completely Kabbalistic in scope, are 
  the result of Paul's vision of Christ. He did not learn it from the others, 
  but rather taught it to them, forty years or more before the first written gospels 
  began to be carried throughout the early Christian communities. Actually everyone 
  was instructing everyone during that period. It took all that time for the adepts 
  to sort out their theological point of view (to take into account both John's 
  teachings as well as Paul's), and (conforming to the oracles), to incorporate 
  the whole of it into a single Mystical Body of writings. Between them they purposfully 
  and skilfully revealed what they would, and concealed the rest--all in the same 
  Body of writings which we in our time call the New Testament. These writings 
  prepare a pathway for the Son of man to follow, and establish the pattern of 
  the <i>Evening Sacrifice</i> to be offered in the last days. (Exodus 29:37-39; 
  Numbers 28:1-4; Revelation 11:13). Thus they anticipate an understanding of 
  these things in our time (as the Books are opened). To understand it ourselves 
  we must relearn the early Christian doctrine of metempsychosis (the passage 
  of certain souls through time and space from one place in history to another--in 
  other words, reincarnation), and then rediscover Paul and his relationship to 
  the structure of the Sacred Oracle and the Mystery of Christ. We must understand 
  it in order to see exactly who it is that has been set at the Right Hand of 
  this sublime mystery:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE CHRIST PRINCIPLE...Christ, 
    or the Higher Self, is the fundamental principle underlying the idea of personnel 
    Godhood; and is the Divine Life which proceeds forth from the Absolute, as 
    the Son from the Father, to enter the world of manifestation and animate all 
    things. He it is who is the Divine Sacrifice, in that he limits himself within 
    all his creatures...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now through that Divine effort 
    of manifestation, all that is expressed and comprised in mineral, vegetal, 
    animal and human, is lived through in due order in this underworld, whilst 
    the essential Christ, the Lord in heaven, is &quot;seated at the Right Hand 
    of the Father;&quot; that is, he lives as the Power Actual proceeding from 
    Power Potential. He comes forth in the world-cycle as Savior and Judge in 
    innumerable forms as the One Life operating diversely in many sheaths.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FIRST PERIOD...A.D. 30 to A.D. 
    80. The APOSTOLIC AGE...This is an attempt to write a history of the Christian 
    religion during the first two centuries. Not a history of Christianity, which 
    would require us to follow the principles of that religion, in their dissemination 
    through various countries, and in their influence upon other institutions. 
    Nor yet a history of the church ; which would make it necessary to examine 
    the questions of ecclesiastical polity, to trace the rise and progress of 
    different forms of church government, and to notice the manners and customs 
    of the early Christians, and their treatment by the civil magistrates</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are touched upon only in 
    their bearing upon the main object of the inquiry; which is, an examination 
    into the principal doctrines distinctive of the Christian religion, so far 
    as they were known and taught in the first two centuries; also the principle 
    traditions and books by which those doctrines were disseminated... The difficulty 
    of the undertaking is great. THE GOSPELS OF THE FIRST CENTURY ARE UNFORTUNATELY 
    LOST...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Christianity had become partially 
    established BY THE TEACHING OF CHRIST and the preaching of his apostles and 
    disciples, there arose among the Christians of the various churches a necessity, 
    and hence a demand, for some written testimonies or records of the life and 
    doctrines of the great master. But this need was not so apparent or pressing 
    in the first century, and especially during the lifetime of those who had 
    been with Jesus, and had been his followers and companions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the numerous gospels which were 
    in circulation in the second century, not more than three can with any certainty, 
    or with any high degree of probability, be traced back to the times of the 
    apostles. These are THE GOSPEL OF PAUL, THE GOSPEL or RECOLLECTIONS OF PETER, 
    and the ORACLES or SAYINGS OF CHRIST, attributed to Matthew.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE GOSPEL OF PAUL...Ewald, one 
    of the best of the German critics, concludes that there was a Gospel of Paul; 
    thinks it was in the Greek language, and that it may have been written by 
    the evangelist Philip. It may be inferred that it afterward became incorporated 
    into the Gospel of Marcion (A.D. 145), since Marcion was a follower of Paul, 
    and for his own gospel claimed the sanction of that apostle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marcion was a native of Sinope, 
    a town of Asia Minor, on the south shore of the Black Sea. It is supposed 
    that the church at Sinope was furnished by Paul, at the time of its formation, 
    with a collection such as he supplied to the other Asiatic churches; containing 
    the life and teachings of Christ.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was the opinion of Jerome, and 
    of several other writers, THAT WHEN PAUL SPOKE OF HIS GOSPEL (Romans 2:16; 
    16:25; 2 Thess.2:14), he referred to a written gospel then in circulation. 
    Paul may have had such a gospel in mind; but his language is not <i>sufficiently 
    explicit</i> to justify us in concluding, with any certainty, that he meant 
    any thing more than that gospel of which he was the great expounder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is, however, a more distinct 
    trace of the Gospel of Paul in his First Epistle to the Corinthians (11:23-25). 
    By comparing this passage with Luke 22:19,20, it will be seen that the language 
    is almost identical; while the parallel passages, Matthew 26:26-28, and Mark 
    14:22-24, have no such complete similarity, though the idea is the same. The 
    Gospel of Luke, whether directly, or through Marcion's, was found partly upon 
    the Gospel of Paul. That Paul had something to do with a written gospel, which 
    now appears in whole, or in part, in the compilation of Luke, is generally 
    acknowledged; and this passage in First Corinthians, taken in connection with 
    the corresponding passage in Luke, is strong evidence that in Corinthains 
    Paul refers to a written gospel, which he had <i>delivered</i> to the church 
    at Corinth...Paul may have referred, also, to the same gospel in Galatians 
    2:2...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(From the writings of Tertullian...<i>Tertullian 
    adv. Marcion, </i>bk.4, ch.2, <i>Ante-Nicean Christian Library</i>) it is 
    manifest, first, that there was a Gospel of Paul, and the inference was very 
    strong that it was in writing; since Paul is represented as going to Jerusalem 
    to compare his gospel with another, and while there, conferring with the <i>authors</i> 
    of the other gospel; secondly, that it was necessary, for the purpose of verification, 
    that these two gospels should be compared; thirdly, that all this was anterior 
    to the Gospel according to Luke...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The opinion of Ewald is, that the 
    Greek Gospel of Paul was the first ever written. There was probably no great 
    length of time intervening between the origins of that and of the other two 
    gospels of the first century.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The testimony of Iranaeus (A.D. 
    190) concerning this gospel is, that it was written by Luke: &quot;Luke also, 
    the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the gospel preached by him.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notwithstanding the positive language 
    here used, the statement is to be taken with some allowance. Iranaeus was 
    fully committed to the Four gospels, and was engaged in endeavoring to give 
    them authority. He may be said, in fact, to have introduced them to the literary 
    world; since he is the first author who mentions more than one of them. He 
    speaks frequently of these gospels, and argues that they should be Four in 
    number, neither more nor less, because there are Four universal winds, and 
    Four quarters of the world<i>..</i></font><i>.</i>History of the Christian

<p align="center"><font size="+1">THE ORIGIN AND SOURCES OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we do not know where or by 
    whom the Four New Testament gospels were written, scholars realize that they 
    are compilations assembled by what we would call today editors, who drew on 
    various traditions, both oral and written, of the early Christian communities. 
    Because of this, the written gospels originate from complex layers of earlier 
    materials from a wide variety of sources. These include collections of &quot;sayings 
    of the Lord&quot; (like the sayings <i>Gospel of Thomas</i>), collections 
    of miracle stories used by early Christian missionaries, dialogues attributed 
    to Jesus, a passion narrative, miscellaneous legends, and other special sources 
    specific to individual gospels, to name the most obvious.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From a historical standpoint, 
    this diversity of sources makes it difficult to paint an accurate portrait 
    of the historical Jesus. While there are undoubtedly some historically reliable 
    teachings and accounts of Jesus in the New Testament, it's impossible to know 
    which ones are and which ones aren't. This fact was recognized long ago by 
    the early church father Origen, who pointed out that some incidents related 
    in the gospels never took place in a &quot;material&quot; or &quot;corporeal&quot; 
    sense, but are spiritual allegories meant to be studied as such; as he states 
    clearly, &quot;the careful student may observe countless other instances in 
    the Gospels, and may thus be convinced that with the historical events, literally 
    true, different ones are interwoven which never occurred.&quot;...</font>Jesus

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And this gospel shall be 
    preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all nations; and then shall 
    the end come.&quot; (Mat.24:14). The &quot;gospel of the kingdom&quot; is 
    the spiritual &quot;book of life&quot; which set forth the course of the evolution 
    of the soul; it contains the history of &quot;just men made perfect&quot; 
    in all their qualities...The end must arrive for all that is less than perfection...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Basilides added, that the 
    life of Christ was the beginning of a progressive shaping and forming of the 
    individual souls of believers, as thoughts of God, out of the shapeless form

    can only be found within. &quot;And this too we must bear in mind, that as 
    the law contains a shadow of good things to come...so the Gospel also teaches 
    a shadow of the mysteries of Christ...What John calls the eternal Gospel, 
    and which may properly be called the spiritual Gospel, presents clearly to 
    those who have the will to understand, all matters concerning the very Son 
    of God, both the mysteries presented by his discourses and those matters of 
    which His acts were the enigmas.&quot; <i>Origen, Comment of John, </i>Bk.I.

    very deed a revelation of the cosmic secret, the heart divine that beats at

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The canonical gospels exist 
    as a sequence of narrative and dramatic scenes. This is not surprising; how 
    else would one tell the story of Jesus? What is surprising is the great differences 
    among the stories...For example, according to Matthew and Mark, the dying 
    words of Jesus were, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' According 
    to Luke, Jesus dying words were, &quot;Father, into your hands I commit my 
    spirit.' But according to John, they were, 'It is accomplished.' To put it 
    another way, we cannot know what the dying words of Jesus were, or even whether 
    he uttered any; it is not that we have too little information, but that we 
    have too much. Each narrative implicitly argues that the others are fictional...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The matter becomes even more complex 
    when we add to it the virtual certainty that Luke knew perfectly what Mark 
    had written...and the liklihood that John also knew what Mark and perhaps 
    Luke wrote, but both Luke and John chose to tell the story differently. AS 
    IT HAPPENS, ALL THE DEATH SCENES WERE CONSTRUCTED TO SHOW JESUS DYING THE 
    MODEL DEATH (The death of the Cross) AND DOING SO IN FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES...</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And about the ninth hour 
    Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken 
    me? (Mat.27:46). The &quot;ninth hour&quot; refers to the period of attainment 
    of perfection on the three lower planes. The crucifixion not yet being completed, 
    the cry of mental distress and despondency signifies that the soul is temporarily 
    agonized by this transition state, for it is not yet entirely alive to the 
    nature of the highest conditions of Being...When the identification is complete,

    has been exchanged for bliss.&quot; </font>W.R. Inge Paddock Lectures, p.57.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The heavenly Christ, or Higher 
    Self, is to be understood as always associated with the struggling Lower Self 
    symbolized by Jesus. The cry of the lower to the Higher indicates the lower 
    consciousness on the verge of union with the Higher, but still perceiving 
    its separateness from it. The expression &quot;My power my power, why hast 
    thou forsaken me?&quot; (Apoc. Gospel of Peter) must be regarded as meaning 
    &quot;my Divine Life and strength,&quot; which for a moment the personality 
    realized as departing from it--the mortal personality. It must be remembered 
    that it is the &quot;earthly person&quot; or lower personality signified by 
    the &quot;body of Jesus,&quot; which dies when the Divine spark has been withdrawn 
    from it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And Jesus cried again with 
    a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.&quot; (Math.27:50). This signifies

    the lower manifestation...</font></p>

  NARRATIVE</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Without needing to insist that 
    all the mythical (accounts of Jesus) <i>entirely </i>disregard his genuine 
    acts...I shall use the word <i>fiction</i> rather than <i>myth</i> to refer 
    to the study contained in this book, of the <i>fictional</i> aspects of the 
    Four canonical Gospels. By fiction I mean--to put the matter in simplest terms 
    at the outset--a narrative whose purpose is less to describe the past than 
    to affect the present. Of course, all works of fiction have an element of 
    history, all works of history an element of fiction. The Gospels, however--and 
    this is my thesis--are largely fictional accounts concerning an historical 
    figure, Jesus of Nazareth, intended to create a life-enhancing understanding 
    of his nature. The best biblical statement of the purpose of the gospel is 
    found in the Gospel of John:</font></p>
  <p><i>There were indeed many other signs that Jesus performed in the presence 
    of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. These here written 
    have been recorded in order that you may hold the faith that Jesus is the 
    Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his 
    name...</i>(John 20:30,31).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a noble intention, and 
    it is not my purpose here to articulate a quarrel with Christian faith, or 
    to call the evangelists liars, or to assert that the Gospels have no historical 
    content; I write as literary critic, not as debunker. THE GOSPELS ARE, IT 
    MUST BE SAID WITH GRATITUDE, WORKS OF ART, THE SUPREME FICTIONS IN OUR CULTURE, 
    NARRATIVES PRODUCED BY ENORMOUSLY INFLUENTIAL LITERARY ARTISTS WHO PUT THEIR 
    ART IN THE SERVICE OF A THEOLOGICAL VISION....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what does it mean to say that 
    the evangelists were literary artists? Literary artists use their imaginations 
    to produce poetry and fiction, works open to the methods of literary criticism. 
    The Gospels are, indeed--and to a much greater degree than those who read 
    them with pious inattention even begin to realize--imaginative literature, 
    fiction, and critics have been using such terms about them for a long time. 
    B.H. Streeter, for example, wrote more than half a century ago about the role 
    of &quot;creative imagination&quot; in the composition of the Fourth Gospel. 
    Reginald Fuller has, more recently, examined the extent to which the Resurrection 
    narratives are the &quot;free creation&quot; of the evangelists...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of the Four canonical Gospels 
    is religious proclamation in the form of a largely fictional narrative. Christians 
    have never been reluctant to write fiction about Jesus, and we must remember 
    that our Four canonical Gospels are only the cream of a large and varied literature. 
    We still possess, in whole or in part, such works as the Gospel of Thomas, 
    the Gospel of Peter, the Gospel of Philip, the Secret Gospel of Mark, the 
    Gospel of Mary Magdalene, and such anonymous gospels as those according to 
    the Hebrews, the Egyptians, the Ebionites, and so on. Jesus is the subject 
    of a large--in fact, still growing--body of literature, often unorthodox or 
    pure fantasy, cast in the form of fictional narrative and discourse.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This literature was oral before 
    it was written and began with the memories of those who knew Jesus personally 
    </font>(Galatians 1:15,16)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Their 
    memories and teachings were passed on as oral tradition for some forty years 
    or so before achieving written form for the first time...But oral tradition 
    is by definition unstable, notoriously open to mythical, legendary, and fictional 
    embellishment. We know that by the forties of the first century traditions 
    already existed which we would now label orthodox and traditions coming to 
    be recognized as heretical--teachings about what Jesus said and meant that 
    even then were being called (though in a different vocabulary) &quot;fictional.&quot; 
    Paul, for example, writing to the Galatians about 50 A.D., declares, &quot;I 
    am astonished to find you so quickly away from him who called you by grace, 
    and following a different gospel.&quot; (Galatians 1:6). Thirty or forty years 
    later, Luke too was aware of both valid and invalid traditions about Jesus, 
    aware that some kinds of information about Jesus were more accurate than others.

    good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the first, 
    to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theoph'ilus. That thou mightest

    not &quot;authentic&quot; and narratives not &quot;connected.&quot; If the 
    works of those &quot;many writers&quot; had indeed been satisfactory, Luke's 
    account would be superfluous. Luke was obviously writing during a time when 
    literature about Jesus was flowering, and some of it was unacceptable to him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke is the only evangelist who 
    tells us explicitly his methods of composition: He went to his sources, including 
    at least some of those &quot;many writers,&quot; closely examining them for 
    accuracy, for the purpose of writing a &quot;connected&quot; narrative, one 
    that is well organized either logically or chronologically...Luke might seem 
    to be claiming eyewitness testimony as the basis for his Gospel, but in fact 
    he is not; he only claims to possess traditions which he identifies as being 
    handed down from the time of eyewitnesses--and for Luke, one of the eyewitnesses 
    was Paul, who never saw the man whom moderns call the &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul was an ecstatic visionary 
    who experienced, for what seems to be a period of nearly <i>Thirty</i> years 
    after the death of Jesus, visions of a heavenly being he called &quot;Christ&quot; 
    and the &quot;Lord,&quot; and the fact is that neither Paul nor any other 
    first-century Christian felt the need to distinguish between the heavenly 
    being and the &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; Paul gives the following account 
    of one of his ecstatic experiences. </font>(Again, our author can not fathom 
    the great difference of meaning that is related between one version of the 
    Scripture and the other. I shall use the other)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:</font></p>
  <p><i>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I WILL COME TO VISIONS 
    AND REVELATIONS of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above Fourteen years ago, 
    (whether in the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth); such a one CAUGHT UP TO 
    THE THIRD HEAVEN. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the 
    body, I cannot tell: God knoweth); How HE WAS CAUGHT UP INTO PARADISE, and 
    heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter...</i>(2 
    Corintians 12:1-4).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He then admits it was he who had 
    this experience and reveals the words of Jesus in one such vision: <i>My grace 
    is sufficient for thee</i>. (2 Cor.12:9). This is &quot;eyewitness&quot; testimony 
    of a saying of Jesus, one obviously not recorded in the Gospels. What follows 
    is another first-century &quot;eyewitness&quot; account of Jesus:</font></p>
  <p><i>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the Throne and of the Four beasts 
    </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the Four cardinal points of 
    the Heavenly Circle)</font><i>, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb 
    as it had been slain, having Seven horns and Seven eyes, which are the Seven 
    Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth...</i>(Revelation 5:6).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can do no better than to bring 
    our literary judgment to bear on such accounts, using the concept of two different 
    kinds of figures--the historical Jesus and the visionary Christ--in a way 
    the first century did not. When we return to Luke's first chapter, we should 
    perhaps recognize anew that there are both the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; 
    and the Jesus of Luke's traditions, who has the same status as the figures 
    known to Paul and John the apocalypt. I will obviously need to justify such 
    a statement, and again the best way to begin is with Paul's notion of the 
    three ways of knowing about Jesus: personal revelation, tradition, and the 
    scriptures:</font></p>
  <p><i>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me 
    is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, 
    but by the revelation of Jesus Christ...</i>(Galatians 1:11,12).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The major contents of that gospel 
    he lists in another letter:</font></p>
  <p><i>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto 
    you, which ye also have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are 
    saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed 
    in vain.</i></p>
  <p><i>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how 
    that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was 
    buried, and that he rose again the Third day according to the scriptures...</i>(1 
    Corinthians 15:1-4)</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what was the source of the 
    &quot;facts which were imparted&quot; to Paul? Four chapters earlier in 1 
    Corinthians, he had written that &quot;the tradition which I handed on to 
    you came to me from the Lord himself.&quot; (1 Cor.11:23). So we must understand 
    that what Luke means by &quot;eyewitnesses,&quot; and what he means by doing 
    historical research, comparing sources, and judging the accuracy of those 
    sources, is not the same as what a modern historian would mean by the same 
    terms. What one learns from the &quot;traditions handed down to us from the 
    original eyewitnesses&quot; must be seen as having the same status, for a 
    first-century thinker like Luke or Paul, as information gained from visions 
    and from reading the scriptures for predictions of Jesus. The Gospels are 
    about the figure composed from these three strands of information; they are 
    not about the &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; And that figure is a complex series 
    of fictional creations...IN THE CASE OF THE CANONICAL GOSPELS, THERE ARE AT 
    LEAST FOUR FIGURES CALLED &quot;JESUS.&quot; </font>A Tractate Introduction

    that specific sefirot stand in particular relationship of radiation with other 
    sefirot...The face of one turns toward another and consequently there develops 
    between them a path of influence...Such channels are paths of reciprocal influence 
    between the different sefirot. This process is not a one-way influx from cause

  of Luke. (Recall that Luke was a disciple of Paul, and that Luke knew that there 
  was a totally hidden element to the Gospel narratives, and that God has chosen 
  to reveal His son in Paul...Galatians 1:15,16). Then see in Zacharias, the father 
  of John the Baptist, an embodiment of the prophecies contained in the Book of 
  Zechariah, all of which will be fulfilled in the last days. See in Elizabeth 
  (El Sabat) the embodiment of all the mysteries contained in the idea of the 
  number Seven. Understand why Jesus was conceived by a Virgin and born Six months 
  after John (Luke 1:26-33). See in Joseph and Mary (Osiris and Isis) a connection 
  between the Egyptian and Druid mysteries...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">See in Mary (Mare, the Sea) an embodiment of the Waters of 
  Life, the amniotic fluids from which all of Life emerges, as well as the Great 
  Sea through which the children of Israel have passed on their way to the fullness 
  of time and the ends of the age. See in the words of the angel, at Luke1:15-17, 
  and in the words of Zacharias at Luke 1:67-80, a foreshadowing of those things 
  that are coming to fruition in our own time. See in the <i>magnificat</i> of 
  Mary at Luke 1:46-55, a projection of Hannah's words at 1 Samuel 2:1-10. See 
  in the figure of the just and righteous Simeon at Luke 2:25-35, a shadow of 
  Simeon the Just, the Druid High Priest who officiated in that holiest of places 
  at the Center of the Hebrew Mysteries, at the placed named Beauty on the Tree 
  of Life. (Ecclesiasticus 50:1-23...KJV). And then see in Anna the prophetess 
  (Luke 2:36-40), a figure not only of the ancient Hannah (or for that matter, 
  a figure of the goddess Di-Anna), but another &quot;feminine&quot; embodiment 
  of the European mysteries. The root word for the Hebrew-Gaelic name, Anna, which 
  is AN, branches off to provide us with two separate terms that are essential 
  to our understanding of the epic and allegorical narrative of the Gospels. The 
  first is ANnual (or the great Solar-Lunar Year of the Hebrew Mysteries), and 
  the second is ANus, or ASS. And therefore the wholly symbolic and allegorical 
  word of Zechariah:</font></p>
