<p><font size="+1">Please adopt an epic perspective of the Christ Mystery, as 
  we place the last two thousand years of Western history in the context of both 
  Mel Gibson's timely<i> The Passion of the Christ</i> and those things that are 
  have been, and which are about to unfold in the world:</font></p>
<p>&quot;Don't look now, but here comes a Catholic Jesus. In February 1804, Thomas 
  Jefferson sat in the White House, cutting verses out of two Bibles and pasting 
  them together into an abridged New Testament that cast Jesus as an rational 
  ethicist. Two hundred years later to the month, Mel Gibson was furiously cutting 
  and pasting a cinematic testament to his own ultra-Catholic version of Christ. 
  Jesus may be <i>the same, yesterday, and today, and forever </i>(Hebrews 13:8), 
  but at least in the United States anyone can write his own gospel.</p>
<p>Since the evangelical century of the 1800s, America's Protestant majority has 
  gravitated toward a Mister Rogers Jesus, a neighborly fellow they could know 
  and love and imitate. The country's megachurches got that way in part because 
  they stopped preaching fire and brimstone and the Blood of the Lamb. Their parishoners 
  are sinners in the hands of an amiable God. Their Jesus is a loving friend.</p>
<p>Gibson's Christ by all accounts is a very different character. If the mind 
  is the seat of Jefferson's Jesus and the heart the seat of the evangelical Friend, 
  GIBSON'S CHRIST IS THE BODY...</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../UsedImages/30Tree.gif"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169" border="0"></a></p>
<p align="center"><b>Psalms 48 to 51...(KJV).</b></p>
<p>... He came here neither to deliver moral maxims nor to exude empathy, but 
  to spew blood. This is not a therapeutic, ''I'm O.K., you're O.K.'' Christianity. 
  IN FACT, ''THE PASSION OF CHRIST'' SEEMS HELL-BENT ON CRASHING HEAD-ON INTO 
  A PARKING LOT FULL OF AMERICAN PROTESTANT ASSUMPTIONS. Its leading man is the 
  Christ of devotional Catholics who for centuries have approached their redeemer 
  bodily, through the Eucharist, gratefully imbibing his battered body. And in 
  scene after gory scene, Gibson is thrusting that Christ in our faces, shoving 
  the ''Man of Sorrows'' of medieval passion plays into the national conversation 
  about Jesus (and in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic no less). </p>
<p>That national conversation began in earnest after the Revolutionary War, when 
  evangelical Protestants pledged their allegiance to God the Son rather than 
  God the Father. After liberating themselves from the tyranny of George III, 
  these patriots were in no mood to bow down before another distant King, especially 
  since, according to the reigning Puritan theology, he had capriciously predestined 
  each of us to either heaven or hell. So they reinvented Christianity as a Jesus-loving 
  rather than a God-fearing faith, transfiguring Jesus from an abstract theological 
  sign into a living, breathing human being. </p>
<p>Over the American centuries, Protestants have resurrected Jesus as a socialist 
  and a capitalist, a pacifist and a warrior, a civil rights activist and a Ku 
  Klux Klansman. During the Victorian period, Jesus became a sentimental savior 
  beloved by women and adored by children. During the Progressive era of Teddy 
  Roosevelt's Rough Riders, he flexed his muscles and carried a big stick. </p>
<p>Non-Christians eventually joined the discussion. Between the Civil War and 
  the 1930's, virtually every major Reform rabbi in the United States wrote a 
  book or pamphlet reclaiming Jesus as a Jew. Echoing Jefferson, these rabbis 
  drew a sharp distinction between the true religion of Jesus and the false religion 
  about him. Then they praised the man from Nazareth as a faithful son of the 
  synagogue who scrupulously observed the law and died with the Shema (''Hear, 
  O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord'') on his lips. </p>
<p>Buddhists and Hindus have also made Jesus in their own image. In ''The Good 
  Heart: A Buddhist Perspective on the Teachings of Jesus,'' the Dalai Lama recognized 
  him as ''either a fully enlightened being or a bodhisattva of a very high spiritual 
  realization.'' Swami Yogananda, author of ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' and founder 
  of the Self-Realization Fellowship, flattered the Galilean (and himself) when 
  he called Jesus a ''spiritual giant'' and a secret practitioner of yoga. </p>
<p>But Catholic contributions to this messy midrash on Jesus have been sporadic 
  and muted. FEW CATHOLICS PARTICIPATED IN THE QUESTS FOR THE HISTORICAL JESUS 
  THAT HAVE BEDEVILED AMERICAN PROTESTANTS. Few wrote lives of Christ or Christological 
  novels. When the National Catholic Reporter held a turn-of-the-millennium art 
  contest for the best depiction of ''Jesus 2000,'' the winner was not Catholic. 
</p>
<p>Catholics inhabit a cosmos overflowing with sacred power, charged with the 
  spiritual possibilities of saints and sacraments, angels and demons, popes and 
  priests. By contrast, Protestants have since the 16th century sought to strip 
  away those accretions of popery, banishing the saints and slashing the sacraments 
  FROM SEVEN TO TWO (marriage and the Eucharist). Whereas Catholics based their 
  faith on Scripture and tradition, Protestants relied on the Bible alone. But 
  as textual criticism and Darwinism chipped away at the Bible's authority, <i>sola 
  scriptura</i> gave way among many Protestants to solus Jesus: Jesus alone. To 
  be a Christian was no longer to celebrate the Mass or to read the Bible but 
  to have a personal relationship with Jesus. </p>
<p>American Catholics have never quite gotten what this fuss is all about. They 
  access God through the saints, Scriptures and sacraments of the church; their 
  spiritual drama is not a one-man show. Still, they have not entirely neglected 
  the Jesus wars. During the Roaring Twenties, an era as besotted with Jesus (and 
  celebrity) as our own, ''Life of Christ,'' by the Italian Catholic convert Giovanni 
  Papini, spent three years near the top of the U.S. best-seller list, entertaining 
  readers with purple prose and perfervid faith. </p>
<p>Gibson and Papini have much in common. Both are outlanders who found their 
  largest audiences in the United States. Both are traditionalist Catholics who 
  came to intense faith late in life (Papini as a convert from skepticism, Gibson 
  as a prodigal son). Each presents his Jesus with the glee, and at times the 
  bigotry, of a man of fresh faith. Unlike Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ,'' 
  which confines itself to the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, Papini's volume covers 
  the whole story. But the book tends inexorably toward the trial and the cross, 
  where Jews mutate into serpents (''Pharisaical vipers'') and uncontrollable 
  violence rains down. Papini's Jesus is indisputably divine, but he is also trapped 
  in the tomb of the body. This is Gibson's Jesus too: a suffering servant who 
  takes the lash with us, exhales his last breath for us and comes to us in the 
  ''real presence'' of the Eucharist. </p>
<p>There is one crucial difference, however, between Papini and Gibson. Papini 
  hated Protestants, while Gibson courts them the way he wooed Helen Hunt in ''What 
  Women Want.'' ''America is the land . . . of the insupportable Washington, the 
  boresome Emerson, the degenerate Walt Whitman, the sickening Longfellow, the 
  angelic Wilson, the philanthropic Morgan, the undesirable Edison and other men 
  of like quality,'' Papini once fumed. And for those sins, God in his wisdom 
  visited on the nation the curse of Protestantism. Who knows what Gibson is thinking, 
  but he has said nothing to rile America's evangelicals, who have embraced him 
  as a brother even as Catholic bishops have raised concerns. </p>
<p>One puzzle of the reception of the film thus far is why born-again Christians 
  have given such a big thumbs up to what is so unapologetically a Catholic movie. 
  Why are they putting their grass-roots organizations at the beck and call of 
  the producer formerly known as Mad Max, buying tickets by the thousands for 
  an R-rated film? Why are they lauding an image of Jesus that owes as much to 
  medieval passion plays and Hollywood action movies as it does to the Gospels, 
  that runs so hard against the Protestant grain? </p>
<p>The culture wars no doubt have something to do with the evangelicals' decision 
  to close ranks with Gibson, who must be commended for so adroitly spinning the 
  debate over his depiction of Jews into a battle between secular humanists and 
  true believers. The evangelicals' ''amen'' to the movie may demonstrate that 
  conservative Protestants have bought more into Hollywood's culture of violence 
  than they would like to admit. Or that, while anti-Semitism is still alive in 
  the United States, anti-Catholicism is finished. </p>
<p>When it comes to the back story of the American Jesus, however, the decision 
  by conservative Protestants to break bread with Gibson may be telling us that 
  the friendly Jesus is on the way out. CALLING ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE APOSTLE 
  PAUL <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(At last)!</font> who once boasted 
  that he gloried only in the cross, a group known as the Alliance of Confessing 
  Evangelicals has taken American Protestants (evangelicals included) to the woodshed 
  for preaching a ''self-esteem gospel'' RATHER THAN THE TOUGH TRUTHS OF THE CREEDS. 
  And Gerald McDermott, a professor of religion at Roanoke College, complains 
  that American Protestants are reducing Jesus ''to no more than the Dalai Lama 
  without the aura, an admirable sort of guy.'' </p>
<p>Mel Gibson wants to undo all that, and his film just may. Cecil B. DeMille, 
  who directed the 1927 Jesus movie ''The King of Kings,'' once bragged that only 
  the Bible had introduced Jesus to more people than had his film. Soon Mel Gibson 
  may be telling us the same.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p>...His popularity seemed to be surging among at least some of THE THOUSANDS 
  OF PILGRIMS GATHERED IN THE CITY FOR PASSOVER. Crowds cheered him, proclaiming 
  him the Messiah, which to first-century Jewish ears meant he was the &quot;king 
  of the Jews&quot; who heralded the coming of the Kingdom of God, a time in which 
  the yoke of Roman rule would be thrown off, ushering in an age of light for 
  Israel. Hungry for liberation and deliverance, some of those in the teeming 
  city were apparently flocking to Jesus, THREATENING TO UPSET THE BALANCE OF 
  POWER IN JERUSALEM...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></p>
<p>...THE PRIESTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TEMPLE had an understanding with the Romans: 
  the Jewish establishment would do what it could to keep the peace, or else Pilate 
  would strike. And so the high priest, Caiaphas, dispatches a party to arrest 
  Jesus. Guided by Judas, they find him in Gethsemane. In the language of the 
  Revised Standard Version of the Bible, there is this exchange: &quot;Whom do 
  you seek?&quot; Jesus asks. &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; The answer comes 
  quickly. &quot;I AM HE.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p align="left">Thus begins the final chapter of THE MOST INFLUENTIAL STORY IN 
  WESTERN HISTORY. For Christians, the Passion&#151;from the Latin passus, the 
  word means &quot;having suffered&quot; or &quot;having undergone&quot;&#151;is 
  the very heart of their faith. Down the ages, however, when read WITHOUT CRITICAL 
  PERSPECTIVE AND A PROPER SENSE OF HISTORY, the Christian narratives have sometimes 
  been contorted to lay the responsibility for Jesus' execution AT THE FEET of 
  the Jewish people, a contortion that has long fueled the fires of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Into this perennially explosive debate comes a controversial new movie directed 
  by Mel Gibson, &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; a powerful and troubling 
  work about Jesus' last hours. &quot;The Holy Ghost was working through me on 
  this film,&quot; Gibson has said. The movie, which is to be released on Feb. 
  25, Ash Wednesday, is already provoking a pitched battle between those who think 
  the film unfairly blames the Jewish people for Jesus' death and those who are 
  instead focused on Gibson's emotional depiction of Jesus' torment. &quot;It 
  is as it was,&quot; the aged Pope John Paul II is said to have remarked after 
  seeing the film, and Billy Graham was so moved by a screening that he wept. 
  One can see why these supremely gifted pastors were impressed, for Gibson obviously 
  reveres the Christ of faith, and much of his movie is a literal-minded rendering 
  of the most dramatic passages scattered through the four Gospels.</p>
<p>But the Bible can be a problematic source. Though countless believers take 
  it as the immutable word of God, Scripture is not always a faithful record of 
  historical events; the Bible is the product of human authors who were writing 
  in particular times and places WITH PARTICULAR POINTS TO MAKE AND VISIONS TO 
  ADVANCE. And the roots of Christian anti-Semitism lie in overly literal readings&#151;which 
  are, IN FACT, misreadings&#151;of many New Testament texts. When the Gospel 
  authors implicated &quot;the Jews&quot; in Jesus' passion, they did not mean 
  all Jewish people then alive, much less those then unborn. THE WRITERS HAD A 
  VERY SPECIFIC GROUP IN MIND: THE TEMPLE ELITE that believed Jesus might provoke 
  Pilate.</p>
<p>Newsweek's Jon Meacham joined us to talk about Mel Gibson's controversial new 
  movie 'The Passion of the Christ.' <br>
</p>
<p>Gibson is AN ULTRACONSERVATIVE ROMAN CATHOLIC, a traditionalist who does not 
  acknowledge many of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). He 
  favors the Latin mass, does not eat meat on Fridays and adheres to an unusually 
  strict interpretation of Scripture and doctrine&#151;a hard-line creed he grew 
  up with and rediscovered about a dozen years ago. &quot;He began meditating 
  on the passion and the death of Jesus,&quot; James Caviezel, the actor who plays 
  Jesus in &quot;The Passion,&quot; told NEWSWEEK. &quot;In doing so, he said 
  the wounds of Christ healed his wounds. And I think the film expresses that.&quot; 
  GIBSON SET OUT TO STICK TO THE GOSPELS AND HAS MADE VIRTUALLY NO NOD TO CRITICAL 
  ANALYSIS OR CONTEXT. As an artist, of course, he has the right to make any movie 
  he wants, and many audiences will find the story vivid and familiar. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(CONTINUED)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is not very likely that 
    anyone who went to the grave on the first Easter Sunday met an angel who announced 
    that Jesus had been raised from the dead. Modern exegetes are unanimous in 
    interpreting the angel as a legendary figure, drawn from apocalyptic literature 
    and used as a mouthpiece for the faith of the early church…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But mythical though he is, the 
    angel is the centerpiece of the story, and if we interpret his role properly 
    we will have answered many of the questions that cluster around Jesus' tomb. 
    In contrast to the stone at the tomb, which functions in the Easter drama 
    like a silent Greek choragus who warns us how not to interpret the scene, 
    the angel has a speaking part and he directs us positively to what the Jerusalem 
    church thought was the significance of Jesus' grave. The angel was invented 
    to act as a role model for the listener, and he speaks forth what the community 
    thought was the proper response to the empty tomb, namely the affirmation 
    'Jesus has been raised.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHO, THEN, IS THIS ANGEL? I PROPOSE 
    THAT WE TAKE HIM FOR WHAT HE REALLY IS: NOT A SUPERNATURAL BEING WHO ACTUALLY 
    APPEARED IN A TOMB ONE SUNDAY MORNING, BUT A DRAMATIC PERSONA WHO WAS INVENTED 
    TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE CHRISTIAN LEGEND. Later readers of the legend who mistake 
    him for a real angel…misunderstood the literary form, and therefore the point 
    of Mark's Gospel. The Easter narrative, both in its pre-Marcan oral form and 
    in the gospel version, is a legend, not a historical account. IT IS STRUCTURED 
    IN THE FORM OF A DRAMA, A RELIGIOUS PLAY, AND THEREFORE COULD BE MISTAKEN 
    FOR A PIECE OF HISTORY. However, in order to grasp the story according to 
    its proper literary form--and therefore the way in which it was originally 
    meant to be understood--I propose to treat the text at Mark 16:1-8 explicitly 
    as a drama, which I call Easter at the Tomb. If we look at the Easter legend 
    as a religious play, the 'angel' who appears at the tomb is, in fact, an actor 
    who recites dramatic lines that were created for him, first by the early Jerusalem 
    community…and then by the evangelist Mark.This approach may be strained at 
    points, but it does help clarify how the Easter legend developed from the 
    early oral version to Mark's written account and beyond.&quot; </font>The

    most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But 
    when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria bringing both his own

    things suitable for whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he

    The feeding of the Five Thousand and the story of the 153 fishes clearly show 
    that certain New Testament stories WERE COMPOSED AS INITIATORY SPIRITUAL ALLEGORIES. 
    We may call them 'initiatory' for the simple reason that they presuppose a 
    movement from the outer world of manifest form to the inner perspective of 
    genuine insight. They were intended both to entertain and to edify at an outer 
    level, designed to bring enjoyment even to children, yet they were also designed 
    to possess within a deeper, hidden dimension, reflecting the harmonic nature 
    of the cosmic pattern. However, since the unknown scholars who composed these 
    tales, based upon the ancient models, were intentionally crafting vehicles 
    for the transmission of spiritual insight, it is unlikely that they desired 
    their teaching stories ultimately to be read in literal or historical terms. 
    This was recognized by the initiated church father Origen (who was also branded 
    a heretic by the emerging orthodoxy) who complains that 'very many mistakes 
    have been made, because the right method of examining the holy texts has not 
    been discovered by the greater number of readers.'... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'It is important to realize,' Origen

    FROM THE MANY; but where in setting forth the sequences of things spiritual 
    there was no actual event related for the sake of the more mystic meaning.

    THE PAST THAN AFFECT THE PRESENT. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, all works of fiction 
    have an element of history, all works of history have an element of fiction…And 
    it is not my purpose here to articulate a quarrel with Christian faith, or 
    to call evangelists liars, or to assert that the Gospels have no historical 
    content. I write as a literary critic, not as a debunker. THE GOSPELS ARE, 
    IT MUST BE SAID WITH GRATITUDE, WORKS OF ART, THE SUPREME FICTION IN OUR CULTURE… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The canonical gospels exist as 
    a sequence of narrative and dramatic scenes. This is not surprising; how else 
    would one tell the story of Jesus? What is surprising is the great differences 
    among the stories…For example, according to Matthew and Mark, the dying words 
    of Jesus were, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' According to Luke, 
    Jesus' dying words were, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.' But 
    according to John, they were, 'It is accomplished.' To put it another way, 
    we cannot know what the dying words of Jesus were, or even whether he uttered 
    any; it is not that we have too little information, but that we have too much. 
    Each narrative implicitly argues that the others are fictional… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The matter becomes even more complex 
    when we add to it the virtual certainty that Luke knew perfectly what Mark 
    had written…and the liklihood that John also knew what Mark and perhaps Luke 
    wrote, but both Luke and John chose to tell the story differently. AS IT HAPPENS, 
    ALL THE DEATH SCENES WERE CONSTRUCTED TO SHOW JESUS DYING THE MODEL DEATH 
    AND DOING SO IN FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What this means I shall discuss 
    later, but for now suffice it that the scenes have a religious and moral purpose 
    disguised as a historical one; we are, with these scenes, in a literary realm 
    known as fiction, in which narratives exist less to describe the past than 
    to affect the present. In De Quincy's phrase, THE GOSPELS ARE NOT SO MUCH 
    LITERATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AS LITERATURE OF POWER. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in the case mentioned above, 
    the content of the Gospels is frequently not 'Jesus' but what certain persons 
    in the first century wanted us to think about 'Jesus.' In the language of 
    the Fourth Gospel, 'Those (narratives) here written have been recorded in 
    order that you may hold the faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.' 
    (John 20:31). In the language of literary criticism, the Gospels are self-reflexive; 
    they are not about Jesus so much as they are about their own attitudes concerning 
    Jesus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That reflexive aspect of the Gospels 
    is one of the main themes of this book. I deal with the effort of the evangelists 
    to present their works to us as self-conscious literary documents, deliberately 
    composed as the culmination of a literary and oral tradition, echoing and 
    recasting that tradition, both appealing to it and transcending it, while 
    using it in multiple ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Gospels are Hellenistic religious 
    narratives in the tradition of the Greek Septuagint version of the Old Testament, 
    which constitutes the 'Scriptures' to those Greek-speaking Christians who 
    wrote the Four Canonical Gospels and who appealed to it, explicitly or implicitly, 
    in nearly every paragraph they wrote.&quot; </font>Gospel Fictions, The Art

  GOSPELS… </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A symbol of the final anguish of 
    the incarnate soul as it reaches perfection, and the lower nature drops away 
    from it.</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>And about the ninth hour Jesus 
    cried with a loud voice saying, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.?</i> 
    (Matthew 27:46). The 'ninth hour' refers to the period of attainment of perfection 
    on the three lower planes…</font>(Kether-Hokhmah-Binah refer to the Third 
    hour; Kether-Hesed-Din refer to the Sixth hour; and Kether-Netsah-Hod refer 
    to the Ninth hour)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">…The crucifixion 
    not being yet completed, the cry of mental distress signifies that the soul 
    is temporarily agonised by this transition state, for it is not yet entirely 
    alive to the nature of the highest conditions of being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the apocryphal Gospel of Peter, 
    the dying Christ cries, <i>My Power, My Power, Thou hast forsaken me,</i> 
    the Power being the Heavenly Christ, who for a time has been associated with 
    the earthly person(s) of the Redeemer. The 'heavenly Christ,' or Higher Self, 
    is to be understood as always associated with the struggling Lower Self symbolized 
    by Jesus. This cry of the lower to the Higher indicates the lower consciousness 
    on the verge of union with the Higher, but still perceiving its separateness 
    from it…</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>And Jesus cried again with 
    a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit...</i> (Matthew 27:50). This signifies 
    the consumation--the ultimate suffering, and then the triumph over the ultimate 
    ills of the lower planes--the soul's liberation and final withdrawal from 
    the lower manifestation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although redemption as a whole 
    is one, the process is manifold and consists in a series of acts, spiritual 
    and mental. Of this series, the part wherein the individual finally surrenders 
    his own exterior will, with all its exclusively material desires and affections, 
    is designated the Passion. And the particular act whereby this surrender is 
    consummated and demonstrated is called the Crucifixion. </font>(See 1 Corinthians 
    1:18-24; Galatians 2:20; 6:14-17)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    This Crucifixion means a complete, unreserving surrender--to the death if 
    need be--on the part of the natural man. Without these steps there is no atonement. 
    The man cannot become one with the Spirit within him, until by his passion 
    and crucifixion, he has utterly vanquished the 'old Adam' of his former self. 
    Through the atonement made by these means of self-sacrifice he becomes as 
    one without sin…and is qualified to enter as his/her own high priest into 
    the holy of holies of his own innermost.&quot; </font>The Dictionary of Scriptures

      the standard dogmas that are passed on through catechism, Sunday School

      inner understanding of the teachings that had to be uncovered. Jesus said

      but for those outside, everything is in parables.' (Mark 4:11).</font></p>

      willing to sacrifice and love as fully as he did. We can each be temples

    <p><b>The alchemy of human transformation, Christ the Philosopher's Stone</b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <div align="center"> 
        <p><b>The Soul descends, from the higher, invisible world (from the presence 
          of God--the World Soul) through the absolute miracle of Life into human 
          form. (There are Four descending worlds called Emanation, Creation, 
          Formation and Action. The lower world, the world of Action, is the one 
          apparent to our physical senses). Once born into this world the individual 
          soul then begins its own upward (inner) journey (back up the ladder 
          so to say)--from the physical, through the emotional, and intellectual 
          domains until, at last, it is called upon by the Higher World to make 
          the leap from the natural realm to the spiritual again. It has been 
          an evolutionary, spiral process--downwards to the words at Genesis 1:26, 
          and then upwards--through all the regions and psychic levels of the 
          Platonic spheres. (Please click on Images). It is the universal Christ-conscious 
          mind that makes the leap, that becomes one with the whole. (Every living 
          soul will eventually accomplish it, if not in its own lifetime then 
          in a next). The world being the great schoolhouse as it is, newer or 
          younger souls are naturally confined for a time in the physical realm. 
          Almost every thought is centered on their own earthly and material existence. 
          (There is much to work out at this level. Such souls, of course, are 
          always facilitating, and energizing so to say, the overall spiritual 
          development, not only of the planet but of those on the ladder above 
          them). Just as human history itself began at this level, so every individual 
          soul begins at this basic level of human awareness. Each, however, soon 
          after it is born, begins to cultivate emotional attachments to their 
          natural surroundings and to others in their life who provide them with 
          love (or not love) and nourishment (or lack of nourishment). Look into 
          the world, many many souls, for lack of true love and intellectual and 
          spiritual nourishment, are presently stuck at this level of consciousness 
          (at the physical and emotional levels). Large spaces in the neural network 
          of the mind have been left untouched and undeveloped--and thus left 
          vulnerable to dark, negative and erroneous images (to the Divine vicissitudes 
          of the Creation process as it is). On the other hand, every smile, every 
          hug, every kiss, every encouraging word, every fruitful experience, 
          MIXED WITH SOUND INSTRUCTION, creates a positive neural connection in 
          the mind, and builds a defense against the Dark impulse. (Of course, 
          it is not always parents who provide these stimuli. The Lord has His 
          way in the whirlwind, and the Spirit always listeth where She will).</b> 
          <b> Thus when such relationships are conducive to sound intellectual 
          development (when the Inner and Outer worlds--the mind and matter--of 
          the individual soul begin to come into balance), the middle areas of 
          the mind begin to open. The power of discernment, of compassionate understanding, 
          and the potential for higher, complex reasoning begin to form. (Please 
          follow the course of the Higher Sun and understand the general Westward 
          development of this transformation process). Nevertheless, there are 
          millions of souls in our time stuck at this level (at this higher level 
          so to say), at the purely intellectual domain. It is here where the 
          ultimate transformation takes place, but it is also here where man's 
          ego stages its ultimate resistance and its ultimate rebellion. The Christ-conscious 
          mind experiences the resistance, suffers the conflict, overcomes, and 
          passes through. </b></p>

<p>...Yet for nearly 2,000 years, some Christians have persecuted the Jewish people 
  on the ground that they were responsible for the death of the first-century 
  prophet who has come to be seen as the Christ. Now, four decades after the Second 
  Vatican Council repudiated the idea that the Jewish people were guilty of &quot;deicide,&quot; 
  many Jewish leaders and theologians fear the movie, with its portraits of the 
  Jewish high priest Caiaphas leading an angry mob and of Pilate as a reluctant, 
  sympathetic executioner, may slow or even reverse 40 years of work explaining 
  the common bonds between Judaism and Christianity. Gibson has vehemently defended 
  the film against charges of anti-Semitism, saying he does not believe in blood 
  guilt and citing the church teaching that the transgressions and failings of 
  all mankind led to the Passion&#151;not just the sins of the Jewish people. 
  &quot;So it's not singling them out and saying, 'They did it.' That's not so,&quot; 
  Gibson told the Global Catholic Network in January. &quot;We're all culpable. 
  I don't want to lynch any Jews... I love them. I pray for them.&quot;</p>
<p>The fight about God, meanwhile, has been good for Mammon: Gibson has made WHAT 
  IS LIKELY TO BE THE MOST WATCHED PASSION PLAY IN HISTORY. Prerelease sales are 
  roaring along. Evangelical congregations are buying out showings, and religious 
  leaders are urging believers to come out in the film's opening days because 
  of the commercial and marketing significance of initial box-office numbers. 
  The surprising alliance between Gibson, as a traditionalist Catholic, and evangelical 
  Protestants seems born out of a common belief that the larger secular world&#151;including 
  the mainstream media&#151;is essentially hostile to Christianity. Finding a 
  global celebrity like the Oscar-winning Gibson in their camp was an unexpected 
  gift. &quot;THE PASSION OF CHRIST,&quot; BILLY GRAHAM SAID, IS &quot;A LIFETIME

<p>...Shot in italy, financed by Gibson, the $25 million film IS TIGHTLY FOCUSED

  only a hint&#151;of context, with episodes touching on Jesus' childhood, the 
  triumphant entry into Jerusalem, the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper. The 
  characters speak Aramaic and Latin, AND THE MOVIE IS SUB-TITLED IN ENGLISH, 
  which turns it into a kind of artifact, as though the action is unfolding at 
  a slight remove. To tell his story, Gibson has amalgamated the four Gospel accounts 
  and was reportedly inspired by the visions of two nuns: Mary of Agreda (1602-1665) 
  of Spain and Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824) of France; Emmerich experienced 
  THE STIGMATA on her head, hands, feet and chest&#151;wounds imitating Jesus'. 
  The two nuns were creatures of their time, offering mystical testimony that 
  included allusions to the alleged blood guilt of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>...The arrest, the scourging and the Crucifixion are depicted in harsh, explicit 
  detail in the R-rated movie. One of Jesus' eyes is swollen shut from his first 
  beating as he is dragged from Gethsemane; the Roman torture, the long path to 
  Golgotha bearing the wooden cross, and the nailing of Jesus' hands and feet 
  to the beams are filmed unsparingly. The effect of the violence is at first 
  shocking, then numbing, and finally reaches a point where many viewers may spend 
  as much time clinically wondering how any man could have survived such beatings 
  as they do sympathizing with his plight. There are tender scenes with Mary, 
  Jesus' mother, and Mary Magdalene. &quot;It is accomplished,&quot; Jesus says 
  from the cross. His mother, watching her brutally tortured son die, murmurs, 
  &quot;Amen.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, in the age of Roman domination, only Rome crucified. THE CRIME WAS 
  SEDITION, not blasphemy&#151;A CIVIL CRIME, not a religious one. The two men 
  who were killed along with Jesus are identified in some translations as &quot;thieves,&quot; 
  but the word can also mean &quot;insurgents,&quot; supporting the idea that 
  crucifixion was a political weapon used to send a message to those still living: 
  beware of revolution or riot, or Rome will do this to you, too. The two earliest 
  and most reliable extra-Biblical references to Jesus&#151;those of the historians 
  Josephus and Tacitus&#151;say Jesus was executed by Pilate. The Roman prefect 
  was Caiaphas' political superior and even controlled when the Jewish priests 
  could wear their vestments and thus conduct Jewish rites in the Temple. Pilate 
  was not the humane figure Gibson depicts. According to Philo of Alexandria, 
  the prefect was of &quot;inflexible, stubborn, and cruel disposition,&quot; 
  and known to execute troublemakers without trial.</p>
<p>So why was the Gospel story&#151;the story Gibson has drawn on&#151;told in 
  a way that makes &quot;the Jews&quot; look worse than the Romans? The Bible 
  did not descend from heaven fully formed and edged in gilt. The writers of Matthew, 
  Mark, Luke and John shaped their narratives several decades after Jesus' death 
  to attract converts and make their young religion&#151;understood by many Christians 
  to be a faction of Judaism&#151;attractive TO AS BROAD AN AUDIENCE AS POSSIBLE.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<p align="center"><b>FROM THE MIDDLE EAST...(1 Corinthians 1; Revelation 11:8; 
  Rev. 17:9-15...KJV)...TO AMERICA</b></p>
<p>...The historical problem of dealing with the various players in the Passion 
  narratives is complicated by the exact meaning of the Greek words usually translated 
  &quot;the Jews.&quot; The phrase does not include the entire Jewish population 
  of Jesus' day&#151;to the writers, Jesus and his followers were certainly not 
  included&#151;and seems to refer mostly to the Temple elite. The Jewish people 
  were divided into numerous sects and parties, each believing itself to be the 
  true or authentic representative of the ancestral faith and each generally hostile 
  to the others...</p>
<p>...Given these rivalries, we can begin to understand the origins of the unflattering 
  Gospel image OF THE TEMPLE ESTABLISHMENT: the elite looked down on Jesus' followers, 
  so the New Testament authors portrayed the priests in a negative light. We can 
  also see why the writers downplayed the role OF THE RULING ROMANS in Jesus' 
  death. THE ADVOCATES OF CHRISTIANITY&#151;then a new, struggling faith&#151;understandably 
  CHOSE TO PLACATE, NOT ANTAGONIZE, THE POWERS THAT WERE (ARE). Why remind the 
  world that the earthly empire which still ran the Mediterranean had executed 
  your hero as a revolutionary?</p>
<p>The film opens with a haunting image of Jesus praying in Gethsemane <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
  Garden)</font>. A satanic figure&#151;Gibson's most innovative dramatic device&#151;tempts 
  him: no one man, the devil says, can carry the whole burden of sin. As in the 
  New Testament, the implication is that the world is in the grip of evil, and 
  Jesus has come TO DELIVER US FROM THE POWERS OF DARKNESS THROUGH HIS DEATH AND 
  RESURRECTION&#151;AN UPHEAVAL OF THE VERY ORDER OF THINGS. Though in such anguish 
  that his sweat turns to blood, JESUS ACCEPTS HIS FATE.</p>
<p>In an ensuing scene, Mary Magdalene calls for help from Roman soldiers as Jesus 
  is taken indoors to be interrogated by the priests. &quot;THEY'VE ARRESTED HIM,&quot; 
  she cries. A Temple policeman intervenes, tells the Romans &quot;she's crazy&quot; 
  AND ASSURES THEM THAT JESUS &quot;BROKE THE TEMPLE LAWS, THAT'S ALL.&quot; When 
  word of the trouble reaches Pilate, he is told, &quot;There is trouble within 
  the walls. Caiaphas had some prophet arrested.&quot; It is true that the Temple 
  leaders had no use for Jesus, but these lines of dialogue&#151;which, taken 
  together, suggest Jewish control over the situation&#151;are not found in the 
  Gospels.</p>
<p>The idea of a nighttime trial as depicted in Gibson's movie is also problematic. 
  The Gospels do not agree on what happened between Jesus' arrest and his appearance 
  before Pilate save for one detail: Jesus was brought before the high priest 
  in some setting. In the movie, Jesus is interrogated before a great gathering 
  of Jewish officials, possibly the Sanhedrin, and witnesses come forth to accuse 
  him of working magic with the Devil, OF CLAIMING TO BE ABLE TO DESTROY THE TEMPLE 
  AND RAISE IT UP AGAIN IN THREE DAYS, AND OF CALLING HIMSELF &quot;THE SON OF 
  GOD.&quot; Another cries: &quot;He's said if we don't eat his flesh and drink 
  his blood, we won't inherit eternal life.&quot; Gibson does indicate that Jesus 
  has supporters; one man calls the proceeding &quot;a travesty,&quot; and another 
  asks, &quot;Where are the other members of the council?&quot;&#151;a suggestion 
  that Caiaphas and his own circle are taking action that not everyone would agree 
  with. The climax comes when Caiaphas asks Jesus: &quot;Are you the Messiah?&quot; 
  and Jesus says, &quot;I am...&quot; AND ALLUDES TO HIMSELF AS &quot;THE SON 
  OF MAN.&quot; There is a gasp; the high priest rends his garments and declares 
  Jesus a blasphemer.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>WHO IS THIS SON OF MAN?</i>...(John 12:23,24).</b></p>
<p>...There is much here to give the thinking believer pause. &quot;Son of God&quot; 
  and &quot;Son of Man&quot; were fairly common appellations for religious figures 
  in the first century. The accusation about eating Jesus' flesh and blood&#151;obviously 
  a Christian image of the eucharist&#151;does not appear in any Gospel trial 
  scene. And it was not &quot;blasphemy&quot; to think of yourself as the &quot;Messiah,&quot; 
  which more than a few Jewish figures had claimed to be without meeting Jesus' 
  fate, except possibly at the hands of the Romans. The definition of blasphemy 
  was a source of fierce Jewish argument, but it turned on taking God's name in 
  vain&#151;and nothing in the Gospel trial scenes supports the idea that Jesus 
  crossed that line.</p>
<p>THE BEST HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED is that Jesus had 
  a fairly large or at least vocal following at a time of anxiety in the capital, 
  and the Jewish authorities wanted to get rid of him before overexcited pilgrims 
  rallied around him, drawing down Pilate's wrath. &quot;It is expedient for you,&quot; 
  Caiaphas says to his fellow priests in John, &quot;THAT ONE MAN SHOULD DIE FOR 
  THE PEOPLE&quot; SO THAT&quot;THE WHOLE NATION SHOULD NOT PERISH.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="The%20Nations.htm"></a><b><a href="The%20Nations.htm">Israel 
  and the Nations of the Earth</a></b></p>
<p> ...AS THE DAY DAWNS, Jesus is taken to Pilate, and it is here that Gibson 
  slips farthest from history. Pilate is presented as a sensible and sensitive 
  if not particularly strong ruler. &quot;Isn't [Jesus] the prophet you welcomed 
  into the city?&quot; Pilate asks. &quot;Can any of you explain this madness 
  to me?&quot; There is, however, no placating Caiaphas.</p>
<p>The scene of a crowd of Jews crying out &quot;Crucify him! Crucify him!&quot; 
  before Pilate has been a staple of Passion plays for centuries, but it is very 
  difficult to imagine Caesar's man being bullied by the people he usually handled 
  roughly. When Pilate had first come to Judea, he had ordered imperial troops 
  to carry images of Caesar into the city; he appropriated sacred Temple funds 
  to build an aqueduct, prompting a protest he put down with violence; about five 
  years after Jesus' execution, Pilate broke up a gathering around a prophet in 
  Samaria with cavalry, killing so many people that he was called to Rome to explain 
  himself.</p>
<p>Jesus seems very much alone before Pilate, AND THIS RAISES A HISTORICAL RIDDLE. 
  If Jesus is a severe enough threat to merit such attention and drastic action, 
  WHERE ARE HIS SUPPORTERS? In Gibson's telling, they are silent or scared. Some 
  probably were, and some may not have known of the arrest, which happened in 
  secret, but it seems unlikely that a movement which threatened the whole capital 
  would so quickly and so completely dwindle to a few disciples, sympathetic onlookers, 
  Mary and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>In the memorable if manufactured crowd scene in the version of the movie screened 
  by NEWSWEEK, Gibson included a line that has had dire consequences for the Jewish 
  people through the ages. The prefect is again improbably resisting the crowd, 
  the picture of a just ruler. Frustrated, desperate, bloodthirsty, the mob says: 
  &quot;HIS BLOOD BE UPON US AND ON OUR CHILDREN!&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hebrews 
  12:24-29...KJV)</font>. Gibson ultimately cut the cry from the film, and he 
  was right to do so. Again, consider the source of the dialogue: a partisan Gospel 
  writer. The Gospels were composed to present Jesus in the best possible light 
  to potential converts in the Roman Empire&#151;and to put the Temple leadership 
  in the worst possible light. And many scholars believe that the author of Matthew, 
  which is the only Gospel to include the &quot;His blood be on us&quot; line, 
  was writing after the destruction of the Temple in 70 and inserted the words 
  to help explain why such misery had come upon the people of Jerusalem. According 
  to this argument, blood had already fallen on them and on their children.</p>
<p>A moment later in Gibson's movie, Pilate is questioning Jesus and, facing a 
  silent prisoner, says, &quot;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that 
  I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&quot; Jesus then replies: 
  &quot;... he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Mark 
  14:21)</font>. The &quot;he&quot; in this case is Caiaphas. John's point in 
  putting this line in Jesus' mouth is almost certainly to take a gibe at the 
  Temple elite. But in the dramatic milieu of the movie, it can be taken to mean 
  that the Jews, through Caiaphas, are more responsible for Jesus' death than 
  the Romans are&#151;an implication unsupported by history.</p>
<p>THE TEMPLE ELITE undoubtedly played a key role in the death of Jesus; Josephus 
  noted that the Nazarene had been &quot;accused BY THOSE OF THE HIGHEST STANDING 
  AMONG US,&quot; meaning among the Jerusalem Jews. But Pilate's own culpability 
  and ultimate authority are indisputable as well. If Jesus had not been a political 
  threat, why bother with the trouble of crucifixion? THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT 
  JESUS' ARREST WAS PART OF A BROADER PATTERN OF VIOLENCE OR FEARED VIOLENCE THIS 
  PASSOVER. Barabbas, the man who was released instead of Jesus, was, according 
  to Mark, &quot;among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection&quot;&#151;suggesting 
  that Pilate was concerned with &quot;rebels&quot; and had already confronted 
  an &quot;insurrection&quot; some time before he interrogated Jesus.</p>
<p>Except for the release of Barabbas, there is no hint of this context in Gibson's 
  movie. &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; includes an invented scene in which 
  Pilate laments his supposed dilemma. &quot;If I don't condemn him,&quot; he 
  tells his wife, &quot;Caiaphas will start a rebellion; if I do, his followers 
  will.&quot; Caiaphas was in no position to start a rebellion over Jesus; he 
  and Pilate were in a way allies, and when serious revolt did come, in 66, it 
  would be over grievances about heavy-handed Roman rule, not over a particular 
  religious figure, and even then the priests would plead with the people not 
  to rebel. In the movie, far from urging calm, the priests lead the crowd, and 
  Pilate, far from using his power to control the mob, gives in. AND SO JESUS 
  IS SENTENCED TO DEATH.</p>
<p>Clear evidence of the political nature of the execution&#151;that Pilate and 
  the high priest were ridding themselves of a &quot;messiah&quot; who might disrupt 
  society, not offer salvation&#151;is the sign Pilate ordered affixed to Jesus' 
  cross. The message is not from the knowing Romans to the evil Jews. It is, rather, 
  a scornful signal to the crowds that this death awaits any man the pilgrims 
  proclaim &quot;THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the 
    kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and

    sown in weakness; it is raised in Power...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Corinthians 
    15:24-26; 42-45).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>...The Roman soldiers who torture Jesus and bully him toward Golgotha are portrayed 
  as evil, taunting and vicious, and they almost certainly were. Without authority 
  from the New Testament, Caiaphas, meanwhile, is depicted as a grim witness to 
  the scourging and Crucifixion as Gibson cuts back to the Last Supper and to 
  moments of Jesus' teaching. After Jesus, carrying his cross, sees the faces 
  of the priests, he is shown saying: &quot;No one takes my life from me, but 
  I lay it down of my own accord.&quot; Is this intended to absolve the priests? 
  Perhaps. From the cross, Jesus says: &quot;Forgive them, for they know not what 
  they do.&quot;</p>
<p>As clouds gather and Jesus dies, a single raindrop&#151;a tear from God the 
  Father?&#151;falls from the sky. A storm has come; the gates of hell are broken; 
  back in the Temple, Caiaphas, buffeted by the earthquake, cries out in anguish 
  amid the gloom. Then there is light, and a discarded shroud, AND A RISEN CHRIST 
  BEARING THE STIGMATA LEAVES THE TOMB. It is Easter.</p>

<p>...Are the gospels themselves anti-Semitic? Not in the sense the term has come 
  to mean in the early 21st century, but they are polemics, written by followers 
  of a certain sect who disdained other factions in the way the Old Testament 
  was dismissive of, say, Israelite religious practices not sanctioned by Jerusalem. 
  WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE MILIEU IN WHICH THE TEXTS WERE COMPOSED, WE CAN EASILY 
  MISINTERPRET THEM. The tragic history of the persecution of the Jewish people 
  since the Passion clearly shows WHAT CAN GO WRONG WHEN THE GOSPELS ARE NOT READ 
  WITH CARE.<br>
  <br>
  Most of the early Christians were Jewish and saw themselves as such. Only later, 
  beginning roughly at the end of the first century, did some Christians start 
  to view and present themselves as a people entirely separate from other Jewish 
  groups. And for centuries still&#151;even after Constantine's conversion <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">( 
  TO WHAT ?)</font> in the fourth century&#151;some Jewish people considered themselves 
  Christians. It was as the church's theology took shape, culminating in the Council 
  of Nicaea in 325, that Jesus became the doctrinal Christ, the Son of God &quot;who 
  for us men and our salvation,&quot; the council's original creed declared, &quot;descended, 
  was incarnate, and was made man, suffered and rose again the third day, ascended 
  into heaven and cometh to judge the living and the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>As the keeper of the apostolic faith, the Roman Catholic Church has long struggled 
  with the issue of Jewish complicity in Jesus' death. Always in the atmosphere, 
  anti-Semitism took center stage with the coming of the First Crusade in the 
  11th century, when Christian soldiers on their way to expel Muslims from the 
  Holy Land massacred European Jews. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(AND 
  NOW THEY ARE CAUGHT)</font> By the early Middle Ages, Christian anti-Semitism 
  lent a religious veneer to political decisions by the secular authorities of 
  the day, decisions that often penalized or curtailed the rights of the Jewish 
  people. The justification for anti-Semitism was articulated by Pope Innocent 
  III, who reigned in the early years of the 13th century: &quot;the blasphemers 
  of the Christian name,&quot; he said, should be &quot;forced into the servitude 
  of which they made themselves deserving when they raised their sacrilegious 
  hands against Him who had come to confer true liberty upon them, thus calling 
  down His blood upon themselves and their children.&quot;</p>
<p>After the horror of Hitler's Final Solution <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Open 
  the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel on the morning of the 20th century--in Eastern 
  and central Europe)</font>, the Roman Church began to reassess its relationship 
  with the Jewish people. The result from Vatican II was a thoughtful and compelling 
  statement on deicide. &quot;True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed 
  their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion 
  cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor 
  against the Jews of today... in her rejection of every persecution against any 
  man, the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved... 
  by the Gospel's spiritual love, decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, 
  directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Understand 
  Chapter 9 and 10 in the Commentary on the Tree of Life. The Roman Catholic church 
  is not <i>the</i> Church, nor is the Zionist state of Israel, God's Israel)</font>.</p>
<p>The council went on to make another crucial point undercutting the use of Passion 
  to fuel anti-Semitism, either in fact or in drama. &quot;Besides, as the Church 
  has always held and holds now,&quot; Nostra Aetate (In Our Time) says, &quot;Christ 
  underwent his passion and death freely, because of the sins of men and out of 
  infinite love, in order that all may reach salvation.&quot; And his mercy is 
  not limited to those who confess the Christian faith. &quot;The Church reproves, 
  as foreign to the mind of Christ, any discrimination against men or harassment 
  of them because of their race, color, condition of life, or religion.&quot;</p>
<p>If pointing to a 40-year-old church teaching is not enough, we can also look 
  back more than 400 years to find the seeds of reconciliation and grace. At the 
  Council of Trent in the 16th century, the Roman Church stated as a theological 
  principle that all men share the responsibility for the Passion&#151;and that 
  Christians bear a particular burden. &quot;In this guilt [for the death of Jesus] 
  are involved all those who fall frequently into sin...&quot; read the catechism 
  of the council. &quot;This guilt seems more enormous in us than in the Jews 
  since, if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory; 
  while we, on the contrary, professing to know him, yet denying him by our actions, 
  seem in some sort to lay violent hands on him.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Understand 
  Isaiah 4:1,2)</font>.</p>
<p>In the battle over his project, Gibson has veered between defiance and conciliation. 
  &quot;This film collectively blames humanity [for] the death of Jesus,&quot; 
  he said in his Global Catholic Network interview. &quot;Now there are no exemptions 
  there. All right? I'm the first on the line for culpability. I DID IT. CHRIST 
  DIED FOR ALL MEN FOR ALL TIMES.&quot; Of critics who think his film could perpetuate 
  dangerous stereotypes, he said: &quot;They've kind of, you know, come out with 
  this mantra again and again and again. You know, 'He's an anti-Semite.' 'He's 
  an anti-Semite.' 'He's an anti-Semite.' 'He's an anti-Semite.' I'm not.&quot; 
  In a letter to Anti-Defamation League national director Abraham Foxman last 
  week, Gibson wrote: &quot;It is my deepest belief, as I am sure it is yours, 
  that all who ever breathe life on this Earth are children of God and my most 
  binding obligation to them, as a brother IN THIS WAKING WORLD, is to love them.&quot; 
  The news of the letter broke on Tuesday; late last week David Elcott, the U.S. 
  director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, reported 
  that he had been present at a screening when someone asked Gibson, &quot;Who 
  opposes Jesus?&quot; Gibson's Manichaean reply: &quot;They are either satanic 
  or the dupes of Satan.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(NOW 
  UNDERSTAND REVELATION, CHAPTER 12...KJV).</font></p>
<p>Was there any way for him to have made a movie about the Passion and avoided 
  this firestorm? There was. There are a number of existing CATHOLIC PASTORAL 
  INSTRUCTIONS detailing the ways in which the faithful should dramatize or discuss 
  the Passion. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Had we obeyed them we 
  would still be in the grips of the great anti-Christs of the earth--the Roman 
  church in Europe, and now the merchant Protestant empire of the West)</font>. 
  &quot;To attempt to utilize the four passion narratives literally by picking 
  one passage from one gospel and the next from another gospel, and so forth,&quot; 
  reads one such instruction, &quot;is to risk violating the integrity of the 
  texts themselves... it is not sufficient for the producers of passion dramatizations 
  to respond to responsible criticism simply by appealing to the notion that 'it's 
  in the Bible'.&quot; The church also urges &quot;the greatest caution&quot; 
  when &quot;it is a question of passages that seem to show the Jewish people 
  as such in an unfavorable light.&quot; The teachings suggest dropping scenes 
  of large, chanting Jewish crowds and avoiding the device of a Sanhedrin trial. 
  They also note that there is evidence Pilate was not a &quot;vacillating administrator&quot; 
  who &quot;himself found 'no fault' with Jesus and sought, though in a weak way, 
  to free him.&quot; A reference in Luke, instructions point out, and historical 
  sources indicate that he was, rather, a &quot;ruthless tyrant,&quot; and &quot;there 
  is, then, room for more than one dramatic style of portraying the character 
  of Pilate and still being faithful to the biblical record.&quot; The United 
  States Conference of Catholic Bishops, NEWSWEEK has learned, is publishing these 
  teachings in book form to coincide with the release of Gibson's movie <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(They 
  should first read Matthew 23...KJV)</font>..<br>
  <br>
  In the best of all possible worlds, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; will 
  prompt constructive conversations about the origins of the religion that claims 
  2 billion followers around the globe, conversations that ought to lead believers 
  to see that Christian anti-Semitism should be seen as an impossibility&#151;a 
  contradiction in terms. To hate Jews because they are Jews&#151;to hate anyone, 
  in fact&#151;is a sin in the Christian cosmos, for Jesus commands his followers 
  to love their neighbor as themselves. On another level, anti-Semitism is a form 
  of illogical and self-defeating self-loathing. Bluntly put, Jesus had to die 
  for the Christian story to unfold, and the proper Christian posture toward the 
  Jewish people should be one of respect, for the man Christians choose to see 
  as their savior came from the ancient tribe of Judah, the very name from which 
  &quot;Jew&quot; is derived. As children of Abraham, CHRISTIANS AND JEWS ARE 
  BRANCHES OF THE SAME TREE, LINKED TOGETHER IN THE MYSTERY OF GOD.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>...Let us end where we, and Gibson's movie, began&#151;IN THE GARDEN, IN DARKNESS. 
  The guards have come to arrest Jesus. He watches as his disciples come to blows 
  with the troops. Punches are thrown, and one of Jesus' men lashes out with a 
  weapon, slashing off the ear of a servant of the high priest. Watching, removed 
  from the fray, Jesus intervenes, commanding: &quot;PUT UP THY SWORD,&quot; making 
  real the New Testament commandment to love one another as he loved us, even 
  unto death&#151;a commandment whose roots stretch back to the 19th chapter of 
  Leviticus: &quot;... you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord.&quot; 
  Amid the clash over Gibson's film and the debates about the nature of God, whether 
  you believe Jesus to be the savior of mankind or to have been an interesting 
  first-century figure who left behind an inspiring moral philosophy, perhaps 
  we can at least agree on this image of Jesus of Nazareth: CONFRONTED BY VIOLENCE 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and in the presence of the God of

  into public debate, but I wonder if we have gone too far in that direction,&quot; 
  says University of Houston law professor Leslie Griffin, co-editor of <i>The 
  Catholic Church, Morality and Politics. </i>&quot;If you're using movies to 
  convert people, I'm not sure that helps elevate the level of debate in the public 
  square.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(A typically <i>intellectual 
  </i>thing to say)</font><i>.</i></p>
<p align="left">Is Gibson trying to convert people? His reply provides no answer:

<p align="left">GIBSON DRAWS FROM HIS ROOTS</p>
<p align="left">Bart says the industry players he has spoken with &quot;admire 
  the way Gibson has put his money where his mouth is.&quot; His reputation is 
  as &quot;decent guy, as a family man. Sure he was wild as a younger guy, but 
  he's built up a certain respect.&quot; If you're looking for a reason for the 
  <i>Passion's</i> existence, LOOK TO THOSE WILD DAYS. The turning point came 
  12 years ago when Gibson took stock of a life spent literally drinking in the 
  Hollywood high life. &quot;I'd gotten to a place where I was really involved 
  in the secular utopia. And I went for it,&quot; he says. &quot;This was supposed 
  to be good, so why was it all so miserable? I had an emptiness, a void. WE ALL 
  HAVE THIS DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL. I just felt it was time to start looking at 
  things that I'd been raised with.&quot;...</p>
<p align="left">Gibson say it was easy to put up his millions for this vision: 
  &quot;Materialism isn't one of my things. I was just as happy with $5 as I am 
  with more. It was just something I needed to do. Christ's sacrifice just grabbed 
  me, I had no choice.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">'THE PASSION OF CHRIST', MORE THAN A MOVIE</p>
<p align="center">By George Henson</p>
<p align="center">Staff Writer The Baptist Standard </p>
<p align="left">DENTON--&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; will spark a stampede 
  from theater seats to church pews, and Christians need to be ready to answer 
  the questions the movie raises, Steve Pate believes. Pate, associate director 
  of missions for Denton Baptist Association, predicts a pilgrimage to America's 
  churches not unlike what happened after terrorist attacks on the United States 
  in 2001. &quot;People came to our churches in droves after 9/11, and they didn't 
  get the answers to their questions, and they're not there now,&quot; Pate pointed 
  out. &quot;If we don't get them this time, we may not get another chance, because 
  they are going to stop thinking of the church as a place where answers to life's 
  hard questions can be found.&quot; </p>
<p>Pate urged pastors in his association to prepare for the film's Feb. 25 Ash 
  Wednesday opening: &quot;Whatever you've got planned for preaching, you'd better 
  jettison that and answer the questions that people are going to be coming with.&quot; 
  Pate suggested pastors cover subjects such as the accuracy of the Bible, the 
  humanity of Jesus, the necessity of Christ's painful death by crucifixion and 
  evidence of the resurrection. </p>
<p>&quot;This film brings up a lot more questions than it answers, but I don't 
  see how anyone can see it and not think of it as a tool for evangelism. True, 
  this is not the altar call, but it can be the start of a spiritual journey whereby 
  people turn their lives to faith in Jesus Christ,&quot; Pate said. </p>
<p>&quot;It really does raise more questions than it answers, but they will know 
  the death that Jesus went through was really brutal. It's up to the church to 
  tell them the beatings and the death on the cross were for them,&quot; Pate 
  said. &quot;The film shows what Jesus suffered, but there's no transference 
  that this was for me. There's nothing in the film like that. The church has 
  to do that.&quot; </p>
<p>Denton Association has contracted with the United Artists theater at Vista 
  Ridge Mall in Lewisville for two early showings of the movie. While the movie 
  will not be shown there during its release on Feb. 25, the movie will be shown 
  one time on both Feb. 23 and 24 in a 300-seat theater. Pate is certain that 
  churches within the association will buy those 600 seats well before those dates 
  arrive. &quot;As soon as the e-mail goes out to the churches, those seats are 
  gone,&quot; he said. This is simply an opportunity that can't be missed, Pate 
  said. Outreach Inc. has called the film &quot;perhaps the best outreach opportunity 
  in 2,000 years.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition to changing sermon topics, Pate also has suggested churches in 
  his association prepare special seeker Sunday school classes so visitors can 
  ask questions rather than just sit through a standard lesson. In short, he believes 
  churches should depart from their regular routine in order to accommodate people 
  who are drawn by the film. &quot;I'm a huge planning person, but to quote (Henry) 
  Blackaby, 'Our job is to see what God is doing in the world and to get on board.' 
  It's obvious looking at newspapers, the Internet and television that this is 
  something God is active in,&quot; Pate said. &quot;If churches deal with the 
  questions these people who come are asking, there could be a huge harvest. If 
  they don't, there will not be any.&quot; </p>
<p>Pate, who has seen the film, warns Christians not to see the film alone. Instead, 
  he urges Christians to take non-Christian friends or family members with them. 
  &quot;This movie is so hard to sit through that if someone says, 'I'll go and 
  check it out, and then I'll take someone,' they won't go back,&quot; he said. 
</p>
<p>Pate said he would see the movie again, but he would do it only with a non-Christian 
  and only because &quot;evangelism is what makes my heart beat fast.&quot; Pate 
  also is cautioning youth ministers who take their youth groups to make sure 
  all have signed permission slips in hand, because the film is rated R for the 
  violence of the crucifixion. He also advised youth ministers to provide time 
  for discussion after young people view the film. &quot;They are going to need 
  to talk about what they have seen,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>The film has affected him greatly, he acknowledged. &quot;To see this film 
  is a life-changing event. I will never approach the cross the same way. See 
  this film, and you will never approach the Lord's Supper the same way. You can't. 
  It's impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you want it to be a life-transforming 
  event, take a lost person to see it with you. Don't go without taking a lost 
  person with you.&quot; </p>
<p>While he believes the movie is a great opportunity for the church to show itself 
  relevant to society, Pate is concerned about what will happen if churches fail 
  to take advantage of the opportunity. &quot;If we don't have answers to society's 
  questions, there is a real danger that the culture will reinvent itself and 
  leave the church right out of it. &quot;We can't blow this. This is the greatest 
  chance for the churches to show their relevance since 9/11. My worry is that 
  9/11 was easy, and we blew it. This is hard.&quot; </p>

<p align="center">POPE LOVES MEL GIBSON FILM</p>
<p align="center">&quot;It is as it was.&quot;</p>
<p>This, Peggy Noonan reports in the Opinion Journal, was the Pope's comment to 
  his good friend Msgr. Stanislaw Dziwisz after watching &quot;The Passion of 
  Christ,&quot; Mel Gibson's much-maligned film. In other words, the Holy Father 
  feels that Mel Gibson's film accurately shows how events unfolded in the last 
  days of Christ on Earth.</p>
<p>The Vatican has had no official comment on the movie, but Noonan in her latest 
  column tells us that &quot;John Paul II, who even with the challenges of his 
  current illness has more good sense than many of his cardinals, knew of the 
  controversy surrounding Mr. Gibson's film, and wanted to see it.&quot; When 
  he did, he approved wholeheartedly of Gibson's rendering.</p>
<p>Producer Steve McEveety laughingly told Noonan that the pontiff saw the film 
  &quot;At the pope's pad,&quot; i.e., the papal apartments. &quot;He had to watch 
  it late in the evening,&quot; Mr. McEveety said of John Paul. &quot;He's pretty 
  well booked. But he really wanted to see it.&quot; Noonan writes that the Msgr. 
  told McEveety that John Paul II &quot;found [&quot;The Passion&quot;] very powerful, 
  and approved of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was kind of relieved &#150; it's a scary thing,&quot; Mr. McEveety 
  told Noonan. &quot;But Billy Graham saw it and was very supportive, and now 
  JPII. The amazing thing is they're in agreement on the film.&quot; Noonan writes 
  that the pope, in supporting the film and affirming its merits, repudiates those 
  who feel the film, and Gibson, are anti-Semitic. John Paul II, she writes, has 
  done more for Judeo-Christian relations than any other pope.</p>
<p>This pope would know anti-Semitic, and this film isn't. Noonan concludes: If 
  the pontiff's feelings end the controversy over the film, it would be a &quot;beautiful 
  gift to everyone this holiday season.&quot;</p>

<p>Nov. 26, 2003 - After watching Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of Christ,&quot;

  It is a devout, act of worship from Mel and his collaborators - in the way that 
  Handel's Messiah and Notre Dame were artistic acts of worship in previous times.

<p>Feb. 1, 2003 - Mel Gibson, the third most powerful person in Hollywood, is 
  working on such a realistic film about the death of Christ that it will only

<p>Mel Gibson under attack for Jesus film? <br>
</p>
<p>Jan. 15, 2003 - Mel Gibson's latest film is about the suffering and death of 
  Christ. He believes that is the reason a reputable reporter from an unnamed 
  publication has been dispatched to &quot;dig up dirt&quot; on him. He says the 
  investigation has obtained information from his friends, family, and business 
  associates. He doesn't like it, but says he has already forgiven them, presumably 
  like Jesus would do. He said: &quot;He died for all mankind. He (Jesus) suffered 
  for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone 
  nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope and forgiveness.&quot;

<p>The Passion of the Christ <br>
  <br>
  This letter was written by the daughter of James Dobson (Focus on the Family). 
  It was written after a private screening she and her father had of &quot;The 
  Passion,&quot; Mel Gibson's upcoming movie about Christ's final hours.<br>
  <br>
  Dear Friends:<br>
  A couple months ago, I had the unique privilege of accompanying my family to 
  Mel Gibson's studio to see a private screening of his film, The Passion. Many 
  of you have probably heard about this portrayal of the last 12 hours in the 
  earthly life of Jesus Christ. I can say that The Passion is the most beautiful, 
  profound, accurate, disturbing, realistic, and bloody depiction of this story 
  that I have ever seen. It is truly amazing, and it left all of us speechless 
  for a few minutes when it was over.<br>
  <br>
  Mr. Gibson entered the room during the last ten minutes of the screening, and 
  stayed for an hour to discuss the content and to answer questions. He's hoping 
  that my dad and Focus on the Family will help promote it, and my dad has (without 
  question) agreed to do so. Mr. Gibson expressed a concern about his position 
  in the entertainment industry, and said that this film will affect his status 
  from here on. When asked why he made the movie, he said that he had no choice 
  in the matter--he felt called to the assignment, and he was determined to carry 
  it out. Questions had been raised as to whether he can find a distributor. Asked 
  about it at the screening, Mr. Gibson said confidently, &quot;Oh, I'll find 
  a distributor!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The Passion should not be labeled a religious film, or something to be shown 
  only in churches. Compared with examples of recent Christian films, like Left 
  Behind, The Passion is a work of high art and great storytelling. The rough 
  cut I saw contained graphic scenes, including the seemingly endless scourging 
  of Jesus. The crucifixion scene is long, bloody and painful to watch. It's very 
  disturbing, but it's also moving at the same time. While I was taking all of 
  this in, I was thinking, &quot;Christ did this for ME, and he would have gone 
  through it if I was the only one in all the world, and the same goes for each 
  person who has ever lived!&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>To those in the Jewish community who worry that the film, which is scheduled 
  for release next Easter season ('04), might contain anti-Semitic elements, or 
  encourage people to persecute Jews, fear not. The film does not indict Jews 
  for the death of Jesus. It is faithful to the New Testament account. Also, Mr. 
  Gibson, a devout Roman Catholic, does not elevate Mary beyond what Scripture 
  says of her, which will broaden the film's appeal to Protestants.<br>
  <br>
  The dialogue is in Aramaic and Latin. English subtitles are provided, and they 
  are very helpful in following the story line. A decision about using them in 
  the final version has not been made. My family and I tried to persuade Mr. Gibson 
  to leave the subtitles in, and my dad pointed out that those who are unbelievers 
  (or those who are weak in their understanding) will haveno idea of what's going 
  on in the flashback scenes of Jesus' life without subtitles.<br>
  <br>
  In The Passion, few liberties are taken with the Gospel account, and the extra 
  dialogue added helps round out the characters without damaging historical or 
  Biblical accuracy. Satan is cleverly played as an asexual being who at first 
  seems to be an observer in the Garden of Gethsemane (and other scenes), but 
  then becomes a snake slithering between the character's feet and attempting 
  to wrap itself around the arm of the prostrate and praying Jesus.<br>
</p>
<p>The film is an intense two hours. It uses unknown actors, which keeps the focus 
  on the message. By the end of the film (a unique portrayal of the Resurrection), 
  the viewer is exhausted!<br>
  <br>
  Thirteen years ago, actor Mickey Rooney wrote an editorial for Variety in which 
  he said, &quot;The onscreen depiction of religion is less than flattering, and, 
  as a Christian, I pray the era of denigrating religion on screen comes to a 
  screeching halt. And soon.&quot; His prayer has been answered in The Passion. 
  It is a soul-stirring film that deserves wide distribution and viewing. Its 
  message is not just for Christians, but for everyone. I hope you all will support 
  Mel Gibson's bold and courageous effort to portray the sacrifice that our Lord 
  made for us. Pass this email on, if you feel led, and be sure to see The Passion 
  when it comes out. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but every person should see 
  this realistic depiction of what Christ did for them!<br>
  <br>
  Blessings to you, Danae Dobson<br>

<p align="center">CRITICS OF GIBSON'S FILM REVEAL PASSIONS<br>
  By Dr. James Hitchcock <br>
  Columnist <br>
  Arlington Catholic Herald <br>
  3-10-04</p>
<p><br>
  The controversy over Mel Gibson&iacute;s film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; 
  involves significant religious conflicts and the dispute over whether the film 
  is anti-Semitic may not be the most important of those. The claim of anti-Semitism 
  has been repeated by gentiles who regard any strong manifestation of religion 
  as dangerous. Little noticed by many religious believers, there are now influential 
  people in our society (journalists, for example) who simply think that traditional 
  religion should be discouraged. Gibson&iacute;s film is by far the most effective 
  popular expression of Christianity in many years and it is largely for that 
  reason that it is attacked. For some of its critics there is an unrecognized 
  pun here of linking the word &quot;passion&quot; with religion immediately sets 
  off their alarm bells. One negative critic assures his readers that &quot;Jesus 
  was a pretty cool dude&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;most scholars&quot; 
  think he was a political revolutionary, a claim which would surprise most of 
  the scholars I know. <br>
</p>
<p>In typical fashion, these secularists cannot decide which of two contradictory 
  charges should be used to discredit Gibson of that he is a dangerous fanatic 
  or that he is cynically out to make money. He has been accused of orchestrating 
  a campaign of publicity for the film, as though he is the one who started the 
  controversy. If Gibson is dismissed as cynical, then he ceases to be dangerous 
  and those who admire his film are gullible yokels. Hollywood, as we all know, 
  only makes films for serious moral reasons. The accusation that Gibson is actually 
  sadistic in his portrayal of the passion is itself a prime example of cynical 
  hypocrisy, coming as it does from people who celebrate every shocking new violation 
  of peoples sensibilities as an &quot;artistic breakthrough.&quot; (The effort 
  to force Gibson to modify his film, if not to withdraw it completely, is the 
  most blatant attempt at &quot;prior censorship&quot; of the media in years.)</p>
<p>When all is said and done, some of the critics are less bothered by the film 
  itself than by the Gospel accounts on which it is based, GIBSON IS NOT ACCUSED 
  OF SERIOUSLY DISTORTING THOSE ACCOUNTS BUT OF TAKING THEM TOO SERIOUSLY. This 
  leads directly into the other controversy which lies barely beneath the surface 
  &oacute; the continuing tension between orthodox and liberal Christians. Thus 
  the president of a Catholic college is quite explicit about his own agenda that 
  the Gospels themselves contain &quot;regrettable&quot; passages which should 
  be expunged, and &quot; ... which many interpreters of the Gospel mistook the 
  story for history.&quot; (Yes, indeed, we plead guilty.) A minister discounts 
  the importance of Jesus' crucifixion and urges people to concentrate instead 
  on those who have suffered for political causes. (&quot;Jesus did not die for 
  the sins of humankind.&quot;) </p>
<p>A woman who is &quot;studying to be a spiritual advisor&quot; regrets that 
  the film concentrates on &quot;the aspect of Christ&iacute;s life most questioned 
  by modern theologians and religious scholars.&quot; (Even the most skeptical 
  scholars think that Jesus&iacute; crucifixion, alluded to in ancient texts other 
  than the Bible, did occur.) Another woman, who is a candidate for ordination, 
  thinks there can be no satisfactory film about Jesus BECAUSE IT IS NOT CLEAR 
  WHO HE EVEN WAS.</p>
<p>The film could have been less violent. But those who condemn it for that reason 
  miss the point. Christianity teaches that Jesus died for the sins of the human 
  race and that sin is a terrible thing, the ultimate horror. Jesus need not have 
  suffered so brutally in order to redeem us, but He chose to do so, and the Evangelists 
  thought it necessary to record that suffering. Our culture is prone to seeing 
  sin as merely a question of &quot;mistakes,&quot; which makes the passion incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The minister quoted above no doubt thinks of himself as a very tolerant person, 
  but he demands that everyone share his theology and those who do not are bigots. 
  For such people the stakes are indeed high. If the Gospel accounts are not credible, 
  if Jesus did not die for our sins, then historic Christianity is simply a terrible 
  error and people today are free to reshape it in any way they see fit. &quot;The 
  Passion&quot; is, finally, a reminder of the impossibility of that task.<b>

<p align="center">THE STUMBLING BLOCK</p>
<p align="center">By Israel Shamir<br>
  3-7-04</p>
<p><br>
  In the Return of the King, the Oscar-studded film based on the Tolkien's fantasy, 
  there is a touching and inspiring moment: at the lowest ebb of struggle, when 
  the Sauron hordes pour in through the breached gates of Gondor, horns announce 
  the arrival of the relieving force. Rohan is coming, and the looting Orks retreat 
  from the City in disarray.</p>
<p>Such a rescue force came to the embattled people of the Middle East in the 
  unexpected form of a film. This inspired creation of Mel Gibson broke THE DANGEROUS 
  AND IMMORAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN DEVOUT AMERICAN CHRISTIANS AND THEIR JEWISH <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(ZIONIST)</font> 
  SHEPHERDS. Mel Gibson and his Passion of Christ may well have advanced the cause 
  of justice and peace in Palestine more than we could possibly dream of. Incidentally, 
  he succeeded in undermining THE MOST DANGEROUS HERESY IN THE LONG HISTORY OF 
  CHRISTIANITY: THE RIGHT-WING EVANGELICAL'S INFATUATION WITH JEWS AND ZIONISM. 
  Now it is the time to recognise this victory and enjoy its fruits.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p>...The Jewish establishment and its willing subjects carried out a perilous 
  policy of encouraging the Clash of Civilisations, embodied in ideological and 
  US military warfare against the Third World. For this reason, they promoted 
  the concept of a Judaeo-Christian, Civilisation at war with the Muslims, with 
  the Red-Brown, Russians, with the French and with traditional societies and 
  forces. Mel Gibson and his powerful film opened the Second Front of this great 
  struggle within the powerbase of the enemy -- in the US -- by exposing the lie 
  at the very foundation of the Judaeo-Christian myth. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Not 
  the Crucifixion story but the lie of Zionism)</font>.</p>
<p>AS ST. PAUL PROPHESIED, CHRIST TURNED OUT TO BE THE &quot;STUMBLING BLOCK&quot; 
  FOR THE JEWISH ADVANCE. The Jewish leaders thought they secured the US, and 
  that they could safely proceed with this war elsewhere. Their second target 
  was Islam, THE MIDDLE EAST THEIR BATTLEGROUND, and the trophy was to be the 
  holiest shrine of Islam in Jerusalem: the Dome of the Rock, with the blazing 
  golden letters inscribed by the Umayyad Caliphs that proclaim &quot;Blessed 
  is Jesus Christ, Blessed is the Day of His Nativity, and Blessed is the Day 
  of His Resurrection.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">(Where is the place of My rest...Isaiah 66:1).</font></p>
<p>...Zionists formed an alliance with the misled Christian Conservatives, and 
  the US troops took over Iraq and Afghanistan, while supporting the Israeli offensive 
  against the native Palestinians IN THE HOLY LAND. Then came Mel Gibson, and 
  their alliance fell apart. THUS, CHRIST INDEED WAS OUR SECRET WEAPON AGAINST 
  THE ZIONIST TAKEOVER. I felt it for long time; ever since on Easter 2001 I referred 
  to His Passion in context of Palestinian suffering, just to be immediately frozen 
  out by mainstream Jewish pro-peace groups. LET US RAISE THE BANNER OF CHRIST, 
  FOR IT CAUSES SPLIT AMONG OUR ADVERSARIES.</p>
<p>Professor Patrick McNally wrote that the Judeo-Nazis repeated the error of 
  German Nazis; they became over-extended by opening the Second Front. They could 
  not help: they attacked Gibson and the American Christians, though their support 
  was necessary for the Middle East takeover. </p>
<p>Sidney Blumenthal, an American Zionist Jew and a former senior adviser to President 
  Clinton, wrote in the Guardian: THE NEOCONS AND THE THEOCONS (conservative Christians) 
  were bound together for different reasons: the neocons by foreign policy (read: 
  support of Israel), the theocons by their continuing fundamentalist revolt against 
  modernity (for modernity read: neo-liberalism). Enter Mel Gibson, sprinkling 
  holy gasoline on the fires and blowing up the cultural contradictions of American 
  conservatism.,[1] It frightened Jews, concludes Blumenthal, and therefore Bush 
  must go.</p>
<p>In Israel, this understanding came first. Gershom Gorenberg wrote in the Jerusalem 
  Report[2]: &quot;Post-9/11, the &quot;conflict of civilizations&quot; is often 
  taken for granted; it supposedly pits the &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; world 
  against Muslims. That mood, along with the Intifada, has fertilized an alliance 
  twinning Israeli right-wingers and some U.S. Jewish leaders with conservative 
  Christians. THE PASSION SHOULD SOBER PEOPLE UP. &quot;By attacking The Passion, 
  Jewish groups such as the Anti-Defamation League helped to publicize it. I don,t 
  think they had a better option. To ignore a film in which Pilate is a softy 
  and the Jews cry for Jesus, blood would be equivalent to pleading &quot;no contest&quot; 
  to the West's oldest calumny. But the Passion affair underlines the absurdity 
  of the romance between Jewish groups (including the ADL) and the Christian Right.</p>
<p>Gershom Gorenberg is right. THIS ALLIANCE OF CHRIST-LOVING AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES 
  AND CHRIST-HATING JEWISH LEADERSHIP WAS ABSURD FROM THE BEGINNING. The Christians 
  in the US, as elsewhere, belong to the traditional all-embracing faith of love 
  to the poor and downtrodden. The Jewish establishment subscribes to the faith 
  which is good for the rich and powerful Chosen People, whether Jews or godless 
  Mammon worshippers. Their alliance was a peculiar quirk of history that brought 
  mankind to the edge of the abyss.</p>
<p>As a last, bizarre stroke of this alliance, on March 5th, 2004, the Arab-bashing 
  Pat Robertson appealed on his blasphemously-named Christian Broadcasting Network 
  (CBN), to the American Christians to join with Jews this year to celebrate the 
  Festival of Purim. Those who answer his call will celebrate together with hundreds 
  of followers and admirers of a fundamentalist American Jew, Baruch Goldstein, 
  who slaughtered dozens of worshippers in the city of Abraham, Hebron on Purim 
  in 1994. His burial place in Kiriyat Arba is the location for Purim celebrations 
  for many Israeli Jews, reported a Jerusalem weekly Kol HaIr on March 5, 2004. 
  It is probably the least-likely festival for a Christian to celebrate together 
  with Jews. By his call, Robertson plainly presented his anti-Christian credentials. 
  His enmity is not reserved for the Muslims only: Robertson also attacked Russia 
  and accused this Christian nation of plotting the &quot;gassing of Jews and 
  Jewish children&quot; which is a horrible blood libel against a country that 
  has a Jewish Prime Minister. But his support for Zionist atrocities in Palestine 
  would suffice for the viewers of Gibson's film to reject Robertson and his preaching 
  of hate.</p>
<p>God knows, there are other Christian forces, and the enthusiastic welcome received 
  by Gibson's film proves that they are the real majority. The Reverend Charles 
  Carlson of www.whtt.org runs Project Straight Gate, which speaks against the 
  war in Iraq and Palestine. On a recent pro-life demonstration they called upon 
  their fellow-Americans to care about lives of Iraqi and Palestinian children 
  as much as for the unborn children of America. Their signs read &quot;Innocent 
  Blood on Our Hands, Iraq - Gaza, and &quot;Choose Peace, not War. They called 
  upon &quot;fellow Christ-followers to oppose successive slaughter in the Middle 
  East. Americans are now among the victims of the war almost every day. But even 
  when none of 'ours' are killed, they are being fashioned into assassins and 
  brutal occupiers, which is not what most Christ-followers should desire for 
  their children.[3]</p>
<p>II <br>
  GIBSON'S FILM EXPRESSES FOREBODINGS OF THE SECOND COMING. It brings greater 
  awakening into Christian hearts in the Lent; IT RESTORES THE ALMOST-FORGOTTEN 
  TRADITION OF PASSION PLAYES; IT SEPARATES LAMBS FROM THE GOATS. Not only have 
  Abe Foxman of ADL and Mervin Hier of Wiesenthal Centre exposed their hostility 
  to Christ, but crypto-Zionist Michael Lerner of Tikkun sent his disciples to 
  give away anti-Christian leaflets at the movie theatres. Lerner began as a peace-seeker, 
  but soon turned out to be a Zionist Trojan horse in the peace camp.</p>
<p>On the other side, Mark Bruzonsky of MER, a longtime friend of Palestine, condemned 
  the Jewish establishment's attempt &quot;to relentlessly crucify Gibson for 
  trying to tell the story as he knows it, or rather as he believes it, [as] in 
  itself a kind of intellectual and political blasphemy. Rather Gibson should 
  be thanked for standing his ground, making his movie, telling his story, AND 
  MAKING ALL OF US PONDER AND THINK AND FEEL...WHETHER JEW, CHRISTIAN, MUSLIM, 
  BUDDHIST, ATHEIST...OR JUST PLAIN HUMAN. Our friend Gilad Atzmon published a 
  strong essay supporting Gibson, while brave Jeff Blankfort of California wrote 
  that it confirms the reality of Jewish control over Hollywood.</p>
<p>Indeed, this film unveiled the anti-Christian intentions of American Jewry. 
  The New York Times reported that the chairmen of major studios said they would 
  avoid working with Mr. Gibson because of The Passion of the Christ. One of them 
  explained: &quot;It doesn't matter what I say. It'll matter what I do. I will 
  do something. I won't hire him. I won't support anything he's part of.[4] Because 
  they run Hollywood it is not strange that America produces anti-Christian films 
  seeping with hatred for the poor, downtrodden, un-Chosen people, be it American 
  rednecks or Arabs, Russians or Latin Americans. The US newspapers, too, gave 
  vast coverage to the hostile positions of Jews on the subject of Passion, showing 
  an incredible bias well known to us friends of Palestine.</p>
<p>Their fear and loathing shows that this film can change America; and therefore 
  it can change the world. American Christians can recognise the urgent need to 
  free their media from the deadly grip of Christ's enemies. They can attune their 
  policies towards Christ, share their worldly goods with the needy, return their 
  sons from overseas wars, turn their mighty arms industry into ploughshare makers 
  to feed the hungry; reject Mammon; promote spirituality and be a good neighbour 
  to all nations of the Earth.</p>
<p>Let them remember: the Passion of Christ is not a millennia-old event: even 
  today, as I write, IT IS THE FUNDS AND WEAPONS SENT BY THE US THAT ARE HELPING 
  THE JEWS TO CRUCIFY PALESTINE. They besiege the Nativity town of Bethlehem and 
  plot to destroy the Dome of the Rock with its benedictions of Christ. The horrors 
  of the Passion presented by Mel Gibson are inflicted daily on the captive Palestinians. 
  THEY ARE KILLED BY THE HUNDREDS, TORTURED BY THE THOUSANDS AND STARVED BY THE 
  MILLIONS. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT OR IGNORE THIS PERSECUTION WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO 
  WASH THEIR HANDS OF THEIR BLOOD.</p>
<p>THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL SHOW WHETHER THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS 
  CARE FOR CHRIST; whether they are an independent political power at all, or 
  just an alibi-providing Gentile front for the Jewish policies; whether the only 
  political swing possible in the US is that between pro-Likud Bush and pro-Labour 
  Kerry. It is the time for Americans to regain their lost independence. BUT FOR 
  THAT, THEY WILL NEED A MIRACLE</p>

<p align="center">Following 'American Idol' on Fox TV</p>
<p align="center">by Douglas Herman </p>
<p align="center">&quot;Forgive them father, for they know not what they do.&quot; 
</p>
<p>A coalition of the willing tortured Jesus Christ, it was reported yesterday. 
</p>
<p>A loose coalition of civilian contractors, powerful Judeocons and jackbooted 
  Christian thugs followed a weekend of torture with the murder of an alleged, 
  innocent political prisoner. Denied a fair trial and falsely imprisoned--according 
  to a few of his followers--the Accused wore a cloak and crown of thorns and 
  suffered severe humiliation. Stripped naked, He was allegedly beaten with the 
  lash and forced to mount a wooden cross before uttering the last words quoted 
  above. Those involved in the accidental death denied any blame and instead pointed 
  to the obvious guilt of the Accused.</p>
<p>We make controversial, blockbuster movies of tortured prophets--does anyone 
  remember &quot;The Passion of The Christ&quot;?--while blithely installing bloodthirsty 
  torturers in power to do our dirty work. Now that we've finally gotten caught 
  doing the dirty work ourselves, the whole world recognizes us for the despicable 
  villians we've been for at least the last full century. Terror and torture is 
  what we do so well. Torture is our stock in trade since we've become a global 
  superpower. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Torture2.jpg" width="272" height="347"></p>
<p>Does anyone see the ghostly image of the KKK in this photograph (alongside 
  the lynched American) or recognize the similarity to El Greco's painting of 
  the Crucifixion? Maybe the Ayatollah Khomeini was correct when he called America 
  &quot;The Great Satan.&quot; Perhaps this was only a bit of pagan, Halloween 
  pageantry &quot;fun,&quot; but to a billion Muslims, Khomeini now stands correct 
  in his assessment of Americans unless actual punishment is handed down to the 
  culprits and damn quickly. </p>
<p>Or was this despicable mockery really intended to insult not only an individual 
  but a nation, a culture and a religion? As a veteran and a Christian, I feel 
  the &quot;civilian&quot; torturers (CIA-Mossad?) should be given the same medicine 
  they prescribed to their victims. Let the punishment fit the crime, as Solomon 
  would have said. Not that something like that will ever happen in the USA. </p>
<p>For we Americans are lesser men than Solomon, lesser than our Founding Fathers, 
  lesser even than the British Redcoats we rebelled against in 1776. Indeed, soon 
  after the Boston Massacre, the British soldiers who shot and killed five Bostonians 
  were tried and imprisoned, and two soldiers were branded for their crime. No 
  such punishment--if any punishment at all--awaits our &quot;civilian contractor&quot;/torturers. 
  Possibly a harsh slap on the wrist and demotion awaits the low-ranking enlisted 
  guards, but nothing for their superiors in the Pentagon and White House who 
  encouraged this war, for--as Jesus was well aware--justice is twisted to favor 
  the torturers in a nation that condones and encourages torture as state policy. 
</p>
<p>Leave it to the Brits to hand down some severe and swift punishment in the 
  next few weeks--which they will--while our Judeocons and jackbooted Christians 
  make excuses, spin, deny and point fingers--which they will. Our black and Latin 
  enlisted soldiers, however, should consider who, or what, they are serving, 
  whether an ideal of equality or the brutality of a new master race. The crucifix 
  they wear around their necks shouldn't represent an occupation or insignia of 
  thuggery, but serve as a reminder and remembrance of One who was tortured and 
  killed while defending the downtrodden, the destitute and the imprisoned. Let 
  the criminals in high office deny any responsibility; after all, that's what 
  they did two thousand years ago and are still doing today. </p>
