<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There is no doubt that at 
    first it was held to be a mountain top, and generally identified with Greece's 
    highest mountain top, Mt. Olympus in Thessaly, in the northeast of Greece. 
    But even in the earliest Greek poem, the Iliad,, this idea is beginning to 
    give way to the idea of an Olympus in some mysterious region far above all 
    the mountains of the earth. In one passage of the Iliad, Zeus talks to the 
    gods from 'the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus,' clearly a mountain. But 
    only a little further on he says that if he willed he could hang Earth and 
    Sea from the pinnacle of Olympus,' clearly no longer a mountain. Even so, 
    it is not heaven. Homer makes Poseidon say that he rules the sea, Hades the 
    dead, Zeus the heavens, but Olympus is common to all three.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherever it was, the entrance to 
    it was a great gate of Clouds kept by the Seasons...It was an abode of perfect 
    blessedness. No wind, Homer says, ever shakes the untroubled peace of Olympus, 
    (see John 14:27); no rain ever falls there or snow, but the cloudless firmament 
    stretches around it on all sides and the white glory of sunshine is diffused 
    upon its walls.&quot; </font>Mythology, by Edith Hamilton, p. 25<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">If one strikes a line from Athens through Mt. Olympus in Thessaly 
  they will arrive again at that place in the center of Europe, at the Navel of 
  the Earth, and the place named Beauty on the Tree of Life. It is that place 
  in the Mind of Reality itself which <i>literally</i> separates <i>Jerusalem 
  from Athens</i>. Or to put it another way: the mind of the higher Israel from 
  the mind of Egypt. (Exodus, chapter 19 is a prophetic description of the events 
  that emanated into the world from this place in the center of Europe in the 
  20th century).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We are told that when the Romans came up into that place in 
  the first century B.C. they found a temple on Fraunberg, <i>the Woman's Mountain</i>, 
  in Austria, dedicated to Norea. The translator of the Gnostic text, <i>The Reality 
  of the Rulers, </i>interprets her name <i>Orea</i> from the Greek &quot;Horaia,&quot; 
  meaning Beautiful, or Beauty, a varient form of Norea. (<i>The Gnostic Scriptures</i>, 
  by Bentley Layton, p.73):</font></p>
<blockquote>

    upon me, O self-begotten perfect One, who is not outside me. I see thee, O 
    thou who art visible to everyone. For who will be able to comprehend thee 
    in another tongue? Now that I have known thee, I have mixed myself with the 
    immutable. I have armed myself with the armour of light. I have become light. 
    Because the Mother was at that place because of the splendid Beauty of grace. 
    Therefore I have stretched out my hands while they were folded. I was shaped 
    in a circle of the riches of the light which is in my bosom...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We have learned of old Chronus's flight to <i>Italy</i> after 
  the overthrow and collapse of the ancient Atlantean order. He was deposed by 
  the newly emerging Olympian gods, who have also employed the aid of certain 
  of the old Titans, or Giants (Genesis 6:4). Among these were the One-eyed Cyclops. 
  (Can anyone recognize Old Kether here, the Ancient of Days)? The legend must 
  have served to assure Rome that it was indeed the repository of the mysteries 
  of ancient times--The true <i>Eternal</i> <i>City</i>. Others, however, said 
  that Chronus, or Saturn, fled to the West. And this is true because when Aeneas 
  and his band landed on the Western shore of the Italian peninsular they also 
  thought that they had landed on the Western shores of the World-mystery itself--on 
  the shores of Eden:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What we have in the legend of Saturn's flight to <i>Italy</i> 
  (the original I'tal-y in the West) is an account of the arrival of the adepts 
  of the Adamic revelation in Central Europe toward the end of the Atlantean age. 
  The Book of Genesis recalls the end of this age in the 1600 years that transpired 
  between the times of Adam and Noah--the Ten Ancient Worthies (4000 - 2400 B.C.). 
  The old, Atlantean age was sinking--not only into the myst of human recollection, 
  but beneath successive waves of tribal warfare. (The tribes, of course, have 
  grown over time into nations and empires...Daniel 9:26; Matthew 24:6-8)...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/VedicWorld.gif" width="697" height="394"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The next age was emerging--A Vedic age in the East and a Dynastic 
  age of pyramid builders in Egypt. The archetypal structure and the design of 
  the Tree of Life were beginning to inform and connect the various peoples and 
  cultures of the earth. These adepts in the emerging Adamic religion made their 
  alliances with all that was true, overcame all that was untrue, and in so doing 
  began to supplant the old world views with a higher or more developed (monotheistic) 
  sense of the mystery of God's Presence in the natural order. Time (Old Chronus) 
  was not devouring all of his children. There was meaning to it all, and a divine 
  plan was unfolding. Thus possessing now, for the first time in human history, 
  a gift of prophecy, they began to commit to the treasuries of Time itself (away 
  from the minds of the sons of Darkness) all that was to come to pass at the 
  end of the age...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks 
    are all children, and there is no such thing as an old Greek. 'What do you 
    mean by that?' inquired Solon. 'You are all young in mind,' came the reply: 
    'you have no belief rooted in the old tradition, and no knowledge hoary with 
    age. And the reason is this. There have been and will be many different calamities 
    to destroy mankind, the greatest of them by fire and water, lesser ones by 
    countless other means. Your own story of how Phaethon, child of the sun, harnessed 
    his father's chariot, but was unable to guide it along his father's course 
    and so burnt up things on the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt, 
    is a mythical version of the truth that there is at long intervals a variation 
    in the course of heavenly and a consequent widespread destruction by fire 
    of things on the earth&#133;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our records tell how your city 
    checked a great power which arrogantly advanced from its base in the Atlantic 
    ocean to attack the cities of Europe and Asia. For in those days the Atlantic 
    was navigable. There was an island </font>(a continent)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    opposite the strait which you call (so you say) the Pillars of Hercules, an 
    island larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travellers in those days 
    could reach the other islands, and from them the whole opposite continent 
    which surrounds what can truly be called the ocean. For the sea within the 
    strait we are talking about is like a lake with a narrow entrance; the outer 
    ocean is the real ocean and the land which entirely surrounds it is properly 
    termed continent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this island of Atlantis had 
    risen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island, 
    and many other islands as well and parts of the continent; in addition it 
    controlled within the strait, Libya (Africa) up to the borders of Egypt and 
    Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This dynasty, gathering its whole power together, 
    attempted to enslave at a single stroke, your country and ours and all the 
    territory within the strait&#133; At a later time there was earthquakes and 
    floods of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night all 
    your fighting men were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis 
    was similarly swallowed up by the sea and vanished; this is why the sea in 
    that area is to this day impassable to navigation, which is hindered by mud 
    just below the surface, the remains of a sunken island.&quot; (see Job 41:30).

    famous Seven Wise Men of Greece. The Seven Wise Men, according to popular 
    accounts, antedated the philosophers; the term philosophia, supposedly invented

    save God.' In oriental tradition the wise men evoked an image of a royal advisor...But 
    the Seven Wise Men of Greece...were regarded as Pillars of Civilization. They 
    were the philosophers before philosophy was discovered...Eupolemus's claim

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MOSES: THINK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN...When 
    the Hebrews landed at Mount Sinai to receive the law from Moses, as celebrated 
    this week during Shavuot, what they were really getting was a scaled-down 
    version of Egyptian principles, written in Egyptian. And Moses was really 
    the chief priest of the controversial pharaoh, Akhenaten, who believed in 
    monotheism. So argues Gary Greenberg...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenberg, president of the Biblical 
    Archaeology Society of New York, claims that the Genesis stories of the patriarchs 
    are modified Egyptian myths altered by Moses, a member of the Egyptian royal 
    line who was forced to flee the land after losing a power struggle to Ramses 
    I. The real Exodus, Greenberg writes, comes when Moses and his allies are 
    allowed to leave Egypt to avoid a civil war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calling himself an amateur detective, 
    Greenberg also maintains that the 12 Tribes never existed, and that the story 
    of Jacob and Esau are rewrites by Moses of the Egyptian myth about Horus and 
    Set.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lawrence Schiffman, a professor 
    of Hebrew Studies at New York University, calls Greenberg's theories speculation 
    that rehashes already discredited arguements made by Sigmund Freud 50 years 
    ago...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I fall in between the mainstream 
    and the minimalists,&quot; says Greenberg, referring to a new controversial 
    group of Bible scholars who deny the existence of Israel from Genesis through 
    the monarchy period.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Greenberg, says he has had a lifelong 
    interest in the relationship between history and mythology. He believes that 
    Moses did give his followers a set of rules in the wilderness and that his 
    most significant contribution is his &quot;invention of political liberty,&quot; 
    Greenberg says.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is the first time in history,&quot;

<p><font size="+1">We have here a classic instance in which we must learn, as 
  Paul says, to <i>rightly divide the word of God</i>. That is, we must learn 
  how to rightly separate history from myth in order to see how both are intricate 
  to the Exodus story. It will be easier when the epic itself is complete, when 
  the Exodus story comes to its historic fulfillment. And this can only occur 
  at one place on earth, here in America. (Genesis 15:12-16). That these mysteries 
  were brought out of Eden via Europe, to that place named Egypt in the East in 
  ancient times, and then carried back to the West again in the Mystery of Christ 
  can be gleened not only from the Circular structure of history itself, but from 
  such written works in the Nag Hammadi Collection as the <i>Gospel of the Egyptians</i>, 
  and <i>the Books of the Great Seth</i>, and in the histories of Josephus that 
  compliment them:</font></p>

    and a deluge, which all antiquity witnesses to be an ancient tradition; nay, 
    Seth's posterity might engrave their inventions on two such pillars, yet it 
    is in no way credible that they should have survived the deluge, which has 
    buried all such pillars and edifaces far underground, in the sediments of 
    its waters; especially since the like pillars of the Egyptian Seth or Sesostris 
    were extant after the flood.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Whiston is among those who believe in a literal universal deluge, 
  and cannot see with the prophets that the flood story speaks of the wars that 
  overflowed Atlantean civilzation in those ancient times (see Revelation 17:15), 
  as it is also written: <i>But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming 
  of the son of man be. </i>(Matthew 24:37). Neither does Whiston know anything

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;'Egypt is the image of the 
    skies,' writes Lucie Lamie, 'where the divine beings sail 'the waters on high,'' 
    and so the Nile has a heavenly as well as earthly source…Its periodic rise 
    and fall are associated with the myth of Osiris, divine principle of perpetual 
    return, death and rebirth, as symbolized by the annual cycle of vegetation… 
    In Roman times the Nile was itself called 'the Year.' As one scholar notes, 
    'This conception not only reflects the rather precise annual recurrence of 
    the flood, but also sought to relate it to the magical powers of Time." Seeing 
    that the Egyptians saw the Nile as "the exact counterpart of heaven" and "the 
    year incarnate,' it is only appropriate that the Nile, spelled as it was in 
    ancient Greek, totals 365, the number of days in the year…&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The heliacal rising of Sirius, 
    the Dog Star, was extremely important to the Egyptians. During one period 
    in their history, the heliacal rising of Sirius occurred at the same time 
    as the Summer solstice and, by coincidence, at the same time as the Nile inundation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time is late spring in ancient 
    Egypt. Sirius has risen in the East, across the Nile from the pyramids; but 
    the Sun is already up. Sirius, therefore, cannot be seen when it rises.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The motion of the Earth in its 
    orbit (around the Sun) makes the Sun appear to move East with respect to the 
    stars. A few weeks before the Summer solstice the Sun rises when Sirius rises, 
    but the glare of the dawn is still too bright to allow Sirius to be seen.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally the sun has moved far enough 
    to the East of Sirius to permit Sirius to be seen for the first time this 
    year in the pre-dawn sky. By coincidence it is the Summer solstice. This heliacal 
    rising of Sirius roughly coincides with the flooding of the Nile, and for 
    the Egyptians this association of Star, River, and Summer solstice was of 
    great importance.&quot; </font>In Search of Ancient Astronomies, by E. C.

    of the statues, so full of life, of feeling, the prophetic statues which predict 
    the future by bestowing dreams and bt all manner of other ways…Are thou not 
    aware O Asclepios, THAT EGYPT IS THE IMAGE OF HEAVEN, OR RATHER THAT IT IS 
    THE PROJECTION BELOW OF THE ORDER OF THINGS ABOVE?If the truth must be known, 
    this land is indeed the Temple of the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, since sages ought 
    to forsee all things, there is one thing thou must know: a time will come 
    when it will seem that the Egyptians have adored the gods so piously in vain, 
    and that all their holy invocations have been barren and unheeded. Divinity 
    will quit the earth and return to heaven, forsaking Egypt, its ancient abode. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then this earth, hallowed by so 
    many shrines and temples, will be filled with sepulchres and with the dead. 
    O Egypt! There will remain of thy religion only vague legends which posterity 
    will refuse to believe…But yet sadder things will come to pass. Egypt will 
    fall into apostasy, the worst of all evils. Egypt, once the holy land beloved 
    of the gods and full of devotion will become an instrument of perversion, 
    the school of impiety, the type of all violence. Then filled with disgust 
    for everything, a man will no longer feel either admiration or love for the 
    world. He will turn away from the beautiful work, the most perfect alike in 
    the present, the past, and the future. Nor will the langour and weariness 
    of souls permit anything to remain save the disdain for the whole universe, 
    this immutable work of God, this glorious and perfect ediface, this manifold 
    synthesis of forms and images, wherein the will of the Lord has united all 
    things in a harmonious and single whole, worthy forever of veneration, of 
    praise and love. Then darkness will be preferred before light, and death will 
    be deemed better than life, nor will men lift up their eyes to heaven. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Had Whiston access to the concepts of 20th century cosmology 
  (which all of the ancient seers and prophets did), and learned how the entire 
  universe appeared from a single event, or single point in time and space, he 
  could have understood how the Mystery of God (the Revelation to Adam), also 
  emanated into the world from a common center. He would have been able to see 
  how this place at the center of the World Tree was likened in the mind of the 
  adepts as the Summer Solstice over the land of Egypt; and that the great Pyramid 
  is a reflection in stone of this higher mystery. He would have seen how just 
  as every individual soul is conceived at the navel of its own existence and 
  grows in two directions--downwards and upwards--so the ancient figure of Adam 
  also descended across the Dark Atlantic to the West (towards those events that 
  are told in the Book of Genesis, and characterized in the story of the 'fall&quot; 
  of man); and then ascended again into the East (toward the rising of the Sun). 
  Thus Whiston would have been able to understand how this higher Egypt (which 
  spans the earth from West to East and back again) was the base upon which God 
  was constructing the entire Western mystery; and how if there was a king in 
  ancient Egypt named Seth, or Sesostris, it was because there was a king (or 
  the spirit of a king) in ancient America named Seth. This spirit of Seth will 
  be found in all the children of the Universal Israel--as the prophecies are 
  fulfilled, after those who are like Cain are finished killing those who are 
  like Abel, as it is written: <i>Then men began </i></font>(again)<font size="+1"><i>
