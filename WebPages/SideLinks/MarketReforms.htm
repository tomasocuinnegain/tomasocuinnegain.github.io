<blockquote> 
  <p><b>This is the biggest financial challenge facing the world in a half century, 
    and the United States has an inescapable obligation to lead AND TO LEAD IN 
    A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES, and our obligation to see that what 
    we're doing helps lift the lives of ordinary people, here at home and all 
    around the world.</b></p>
  <p><b>Now the Council on Foreign Relations has always stood for POLITICAN AND 
    ECONOMIC FREEDOM </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(read license)</font><b>, 
    since right after World War I...But if you consider today's economic difficulties, 
    disruptions and plain old deep personal disappointments of--now--tens of millions 
    of people around the world, it is clear to me that there is now a stark challenge 
    not only to ECONOMIC FREEDOM, but, if unaddressed, a challenge that could 
    stem the rising tide of POLITICAL LIBERTY as well.</b></p>
  <p><b>Obviously we have profound interests here. It is a great irony that we 
    are at a moment of unsurpassed economic strength at a time of such turmoil 
    in the world economy. We, I think, all of us in this room, know that OUR FUTURE 
    PROSPERITY depends upon whether we can, with others </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(read

    increased environmental devastation)</font><b>...</b></p>
  <p><b>Growth at home depends upon growth abroad. A full 30 percent of our growth 
    just since I became President has been due to OUR EXPANDING POSITIVE INVOLVEMENT 
    IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. That's why ordinary Americans should care if Asia or 
    Russia...is on solid economic footing...THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR CUSTOMERS...</b></p>
  <p><b>Finally these nations are our friends, our allies and our security partners. 
    WHERE ECONOMIC TURMOIL PLUNGES MILLIONS INTO SUDDEN POVERTY AND DISRUPTS AND 
    ORIENTS THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Who 
    makes this happen?)</font><b>, the risks of political and social instability 
    and of a turn from democracy clearly rise.</b></p>
  <p><b>JUST LOOK AT RUSSIA. Russia is facing an economic crisis that threatens 
    the extraordinary progress the Russian people have made in the last seven 
    years, building a new society from the ground up. The ruble and the stock 
    market have plummeted. Banks are weak. Tax collections are slow. The government 
    has trouble paying its debts and its salaries.</b></p>
  <p><b>Amid such political uncertainty and economic difficulty, some now talk 
    of abandoning the path of reform and returning to policies of the past, even 
    policies that have already failed.</b></p>
  <p><b>At worst adversity in Russia could affect not only the Russian economy 
    and prospects for our economic cooperation...it can have an impact on our 
    cooperation with Russia on nuclear disarmament, on fighting terrorism and 
    the spread of weapons of mass destruction, on standing together for peace 
    from the Balkans to the Middle East.</b></p>
  <p><b>Never has there been a more important moment to set a clear direction 
    for the future, to affirm the commitment of Russia to democracy and to free 
    markets and to take decisive steps to stabilize the economy and restore investor 
    confidence. But if Russia is willing to take these steps we must do everything 
    we can to provide support to them, because again I say as long as ordinary 
    people don't feel any benefits from this in the end it's going to be difficult 
    to sustain the direction we think the world should take...</b></p>
  <p><b>At this moment, therefore, the United States is called upon once again 
    to lead, to organize the forces of a committed world, to challenge the unruly 
    elements of the global economy into positive avenues TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS, 
    REINFORCE OUR VALUES, ENHANCE OUR SECURITY.</b></p>
  <p><b>In this room I think it is not too simple to say we know what to do. The 
    World War II generation did it for us 50 years ago. Now it is time for us 
    to rise to our responsibility, as America has been called upon to do so often 
    so many times in the past. We can, if we do that, redeem the promise of a 
    global economy and strengthen our own nation for a new century.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>ARE THE ISRAELI'S WILLING TO START WORLD WAR III?</b><br>
  <b>Exclusive to American Free Press<br>
  By M. Raphael Johnson<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>According to a recent article by veteran British military analyst Joseph 
    Vialls, Russia has sent the most advanced and feared missile in the world, 
    owned only by Russia and China, the P270 Moskit, also known as the 'Sunburn,' 
    to Damascus and Tehran. This can only be understood as a counter to the Israeli 
    threats to use nuclear weapons against their enemies. </b></p>
  <p><b>The Sunburn flies at an altitude of 60 feet and is nearly impossible to 
    defend against. A few fired at Israel could make that state 'history.' Add 
    to this a new Russian air force installation near the Kyrgystan/Russia border, 
    coupled with a Chinese base just over their western border with Kyrgystan, 
    and Armageddon may be on the horizon. All Russian jets at this new base just 
    outside of Bishkek are equipped with Sunburn missiles.</b></p>
  <p><b> Vialls writes: The gloves are off, and with America and Israel still 
    unable to steal any oil from Iraq because someone keeps blowing the pipelines, 
    Russian and Chinese firepower buildup suddenly slammed the door firmly shut 
    on Caspian oil reserves in the old Soviet republics. For more than a decade 
    American oil multinationals have been conducting 'joint ventures' in the former 
    Soviet republics bordering the Caspian Sea, with the stated intent of pumping 
    stolen crude oil out through Turkey, then on to western markets. Now this 
    route has been blocked permanently, and America is in no position to do anything 
    about it, because a large part of the U.S. conventional army is currently 
    bogged down in Iraq, being shot at and killed on a daily basis. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>For many who have been watching this region as a confrontation between 
    the United States and Israel versus Russia largely over the control of the 
    biggest gas and oil deposits in the world, a new front has been opened. As 
    a response to this checkmate, Sharon recently visited Putin on Nov. 3 to meet 
    with him concerning the nuclear issue in Iran. Quickly, Sharon permitted Palestinians 
    to return to their jobs and eased their travel restrictions. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Since the end of the Gorbachev era, the Russian oligarchs, nearly all 
    Jewish by ethnicity (with the noticeable exception of Vladimir Potanin), have 
    controlled nearly all key sectors of the Russian economy. This, of course, 
    includes Russia's major ace-in-the-hole, oil and gas. The giant YUKOS conglomerate 
    is presently one of the largest oil companies in the world, valued at about 
    $40 billion. YUKOS is the result of a 'loans for shares' deal brokered through 
    the semi-coherent Boris Yeltsin in 1995. Here, the liberal Russian government 
    swapped loyalty from the oligarchs in exchange for privatization at prices 
    far below that of the market. This $40 billion giant was bought for about 
    $300 million, thus looting the entire Russian economy for the benefit of a 
    handful of Israeli citizens living in Russia. </b></p>
  <p><b>When YUKOS' chair, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at the end of last 
    month, the American capitalist establishment went orbital. Forgetting the 
    1999 New York Times's expose on massive money laundering and fraud from YUKOS, 
    the conservative establishment began to lionize oligarchy and, specifically, 
    Khodorkovsky. Recently, The Financial Times weighed in with a giggly piece 
    from Chrystia Freeland, which referred to the oligarch as a 'democratic activist.' 
    About a paragraph later, the writer said - without irony - that the oligarch's 
    model for economics is the robber baron factories of the early American 20th 
    century. Fox News, on Nov. 3, referred to YUKOS as the most progressive corporation 
    in Russia. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>According to a Nov. 3 Agence France-Presse story, Khodorkovsky made a 
    deal with Jacob Rothschild this year that control of the YUKOS giant would 
    pass to Rothschild in the event of Khodorkovsky's arrest. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(I 
    DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE)</font>. However, the Russian government has frozen 
    all YUKOS assets for the time being. It is significant that YUKOS's liberal 
    pressure group, the Open Russia Foundation, is completely controlled by Rothschild 
    now that its founder is in jail. As their official mission statement reads, 
    &quot;The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation is 
    the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between 
    the people of Russia and the rest of the world.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Their board of trustees includes Rothschild and Henry Kissinger. The Washington, 
    D.C. launch of the organization included Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Librarian 
    of Congress James Billington, one of the leading voices against Russian traditionalism 
    in the academic establishment. Significantly, the Open Russia Foundation recently 
    provided Yale University with substantial grants to study the Russian economy 
    as well as providing the Carnegie Foundation with 3 percent of its entire 
    operating budget. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>It seems that the drive to control the globe's energy is progressing. 
    The American empire's battles in Serbia, Central Asia, Iraq and Chechnya are 
    one and the same war. Other than fighting Israel's enemies, these adventures 
    are also wars to control Central Asian oil and natural gas (one of the main 
    pipelines from the Caspian Sea went straight through Serbia). The control 
    of this wealth by the United States and Israel necessitates bypassing Russian 
    channels. This means that the Jewish oligarchy in Russia would become the 
    central actor in world politics. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Israeli/CIA complex was using Khodorkovsky to sell off the assets 
    of YUKOS to Exxon/Mobil (as well as a smaller piece to Texaco), hence bringing 
    Russia's pipelines into the hands of the western powers. The Nov. 5 New York 
    Times also indicated that the Bush family's Carlyle Group was involved. It 
    was not long after Putin began threatening the YUKOS conglomerate that neo-conservative 
    pundits such as William Kristol and Ariel Cohen began calling Putin a 'communist,' 
    'another Stalin' and 'tyrannical.' </b></p>
  <p><b>The basis of these wild accusations, of course, is the fact that Putin 
    stands in the way of Zionist domination. <br>
    From this, the roles of several other variables and players develop clearly. 
    The State Department/Harvard University alliance was meant to 'deregulate,' 
    or 'privatize' much of the Russian economy precisely to keep the Russian state 
    out of the equation. Therefore, pro-Israel oligarchs (that is, Israeli citizens 
    living in Russia) then benefited, placing most of the economy in their hands, 
    and, by extension, Israel's. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Russia's response has been to clamp down on further foreign penetration 
    into defense and other sensitive industries, and specifically, to target those 
    believed to be working for both the CIA and Mossad and attempting to control 
    Central Asian oil. It needs to be reiterated that where the (CIA goes, Mossad 
    goes as well. Israeli and American interests have come together in the dominance 
    of the Central Asian region and therefore, so have liberal ideology, the Beltway 
    set, neo-conservatism, Ivy League eggheads, Christian Zionism, the Rothschilds 
    and the American media.) Afghanistan through the Caspian Sea through to Georgia, 
    Azerbaijan and into the Balkans (not to mention pipelines leading to oil-hungry 
    China), have become one single theater of war over trillions of dollars in 
    oil and gas wealth, incorporating every single power center in global politics. 
    The battle against the New World Order is being decided in Moscow. </b></p>
  <p><b>Therefore, all anti-Russian alliances in the region, from Islamic fundamentalism 
    to Slavic separatism to the George Soros 'Open Society' Foundation, are in 
    the interests of the CIA/Exxon/Ivy League/NWO complex. In Azerbaijan, for 
    example, American elites have pushed for a 'democratic' state, that is, a 
    state not under the control of pro-Moscow Heydar Aliev, thus leaving the country 
    open to U.S. oil investment. Aliev, of course, is promoting Russian interests 
    in the region, and thus, has become a &atilde;tyrant&auml; in the Beltway 
    mind. The American response to this situation within this region is to create 
    the GUAAM pact, including, Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Cohen gives us a clue as to why this entity was brokered under NATO auspices: 
    &quot;The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline will export up to 1 million barrels 
    per year of high quality Caspian crude oil by 2005.&quot; In other words, 
    billions of dollars of oil are slated to be pumped through this region very 
    soon, and the economic/military alliance of GUAAM is the means to ensure American 
    control over it. This connects the Serbian, Afghan and Iraqi wars. </b></p>
  <p><b>Russia's response to Israel's terror threats against most of the Islamic 
    world is fully understood as both a political and economic question. Further, 
    increasing cooperation between Russia and India, as well as China, are clear 
    markers that Putin, one of the few actually competent leaders in world politics, 
    is building an anti-imperialist and anti-NATO alliance with the aim of countering 
    American/Zionist moves for the world's oil and gas wealth. </b></p>
  <p><b>The interests, however, go even further than Zionist control over American 
    foreign policy decision-making. Vialls writes on another topic: that the existence 
    of the American/Zionist empire is based on the victory of American forces 
    over the Russian and Islamic. Of course, both in Bosnia and Chechnya, the 
    Mossad/CIA operatives have not hesitated to assist fundamentalists in fighting 
    Slavic nationalism, largely because Slavicism is a greater threat with Putin 
    firmly in the saddle. Islam, divided and leaderless, with a history of centuries 
    of defeat and colonialism behind it, is only a potential force in world politics.
