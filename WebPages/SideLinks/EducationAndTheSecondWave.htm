<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CARBIDE CHIEF SAYS.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Union Carbide and other corporations 
    have to pitch in to help educate the nation's young people and keep the United 
    States competitive with the rest of the world, according to Carbide executive 
    Robert D. Kennedy. </font>(Remember Bophal)?</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We've got a really big problem 
    in this country,&quot; Kennedy told a group of South Charleston High School 
    honor students. &quot;Ninety percent of the kids that graduate from America's 
    high schools can't COMPETE with other kids in the world.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy spoke at a dinner honoring 
    the school's TOP 30 STUDENTS after touring Carbide's Tech Center earlier in 
    the day. He introduced a Carbide report titled &quot;Undereducated, Uncompetitive 
    USA&quot; that points out problems in the country's education system. &quot;Your 
    competition for jobs will likely not be with someone from (near by), but a 
    strongly motivated person from Taiwan or Germany,&quot; Kennedy said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy is Carbide's chief executive 
    officer...He also works with Inroads, a privately funded group directed at 
    improving minority enrollment in schools. Kennedy said groups such as the 
    Roundtable 200, which comprises executives from the country's top 200 corporations 
    are trying to find ways to form corporate-school partnerships, math and science 
    programs, and training for teachers. </font>(Ashland Oil, a member of this 
    corporate elite, devised the clever saying: &quot;Teachers Change Lives&quot;)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A group of Kanawha County math 
    and science teachers recently visited Carbide's Danbury headquarters to meet 
    corporate officials and attend seminars. Kennedy said West Virginians must 
    get involved to turn around their education system, despite the state's financial 
    problems. &quot;The public has to be concerned before anything much will be 
    done,&quot; he said. &quot;We really have an education crisis. It's not a 
    question of money.&quot; </font>The Charleston Gazette<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please review the laws of God concerning the Nations (and particularly 
  the American Nation Cult), as well as those laws and precepts that govern our 
  relationship to the leaders of these nations in the chapter entitled <i>Give 
  Unto Caesar?</i>, before returning here to consider the following excerpts from 
  a conservative, evangelical tract entitled <i>What Are They Teaching Our Children</i>. 
  Hopefully, in the ongoing conflict in this country between the liberal<i> </i>and 
  conservative<i> </i> states of mind, we will return to these precepts, find 
  the center and gain a fuller understanding of the truly spiritual, and truly 
  phenomenal Third Wave of human consciousness that is sweeping over the planet, 
  and the great gulf that exists between it and the Second Wave state of mind 
  that presently rules the world. (See Acts 2:16-21; Joel 2:28-32). The children 
  of Ba'al (all of those who have been taught to equate the doctrines of Christ 
  with the doctrines of the American state, as well as those who have total disregard 
  for the doctrines of Christ altogether), have not caught the drift, or at very 
  best they have grossly misinterpreted it in light of their own fallen, nationalistic 
  and global world views (see Matthew 6:23; Hebrews 6:1-8), and are become in 
  the end the very ones for whom the words have been reserved:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled

    the doctrines and precepts of their own national myths and beliefs)</font><font size="+1"><i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the great day of His wrath is come, and who shall 
    be able to stand?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 6:14-17; Isaiah 
    2:17-22)...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is not that America is essentially more evil than the other 
  nations of the earth, but the fact that (more than any other nation on earth), 
  America performs its &quot;great&quot; &quot;colossal&quot; works of Darkness 
  in the Name of God and in the professed spirit of Christ--and is therefore (beyond 
  any other nation), the embodiment of the spirit of Antichrist in the earth. 
  And this because the United States of America is literally the culmination, 
  the focus if you will, of God's intentions toward humanity at this moment in 
  history. It is where the Sun is setting on the events of this age. Everything 
  else, even heaven itself, is revolving around it, and has been prepared for 
  the great impending event, the manifestation of the Messiahs and the full-flowering 
  birth of the next stage of human consciousness. (Romans 8:16-23). America is 
  the last empire to hold the oracles and the people of God captive, and it is 
  where both the children of Light and the children of Darkness are being brought 
  to their mutual states of perfection, as it is written: <i>Let them grow together</i>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The children of Light are those who can sense the Nature and 
  the meaning of God's Terrible Presence in the sum of all these unfolding realities, 
  and who continue to find a way to walk in the precepts of Christ--in the teachings 
  of the Sermon on the Mount, and the Eightfold Path--despite the tremendous social 
  and political pressures to walk otherwise. The children of Darkness are those 
  who, despite their profession of faith in the Lord of History, are dismayed 
  at the signs of the times, by events that are unfolding everywhere around them, 
  and by the quickening and emerging insights of others (speaking evil, as they 
  always do, of things they do not understand), and who seek fearful refuge in 
  their own national philosophies and doctrines. (Isaiah 2:19; Revelation 6:15-17). 
  The religious among them have not only forsaken the idea of <i>dying with Christ</i>, 
  but the fact that we have finally arrived at the fulness of these times and 
  the judgments of this age as well.. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The children of Light must always find themselves isolated 
  by those who define the American agenda, by both Liberals and Conservatives. 
  By Liberals (those on the political Left), because they do not want to talk 
  about the precepts and judgments of God, or even about God at all, and by those 
  on the Right who can only identify themselves in contrast to those who do not 
  espouse their political, economic and religious agenda--which is everyone on 
  the Left. Conservatives feel most secure in the climate of a strong personal 
  economy (tax cuts and investments, because they are caught in the complexities 
  of greed, and have forsaken both the law concerning such matters and their responsibilities 
  to the poor and oppressed), and in a strong military (because they are also 
  very fearful of God's judgments). And if those on the intellectual Left shall 
  experience their own spiritual crisis with the reappearance of Jimmy Carter, 
  the Global man of &quot;Peace,&quot; those on the Right are as close now as 
  they shall ever get to a religious triumph, what with a President-elect George 
  W. Bush, a Republican Supreme Court and a Republican legislature. ( Deuteronomy 
  4:5-10; Ecclesiastes 5:8-13). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> &quot;Another Win For the Gipper,&quot; says the December 
  17, 2000, edition of the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>: &quot;George W. Bush 
  may be the son of a president,&quot; says Paul Kengor, &quot;but the political 
  lineage is clear: He's the heir of <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
  great American prophet)</font> Ronald Reagan.&quot; (It was Ronald Reagan's, 
  and his own father's appointments to the Supreme Court that assured George W. 
  Bush's victory over Al Gore in the race to see who would be the next to occupy 
  the seat of the American antichrists. Gore can thank heaven for the defeat). 
  There are those who--after all this time, after all the great historical events 
  that have unfolded before our eyes in the 20th century--have failed in the end 
  to perceive the Presence of God in the affairs of the world, or to discern the 
  great subtle difference that exists between that which is serves God's will 
  (the rest of the world) and that which opposes God's will (America...as if such 
  a thing was actually possible), and who are, therefore, still unable to digest 
  the strong meat of God's word. (Hebrews 5:12-14; Hebrews 6:1-11; 2 Thessalonians 
  2:1-12). The question, as a result, begs itself: What would <i>they</i>, or 
  rather, what have <i>they</i> been teaching our children instead? (It is now 
  March, 2003, and I do believe I see our sons and daughters, and our brothers 
  and sisters, being sent off to kill others and to be killed in George Bush's 
  foreign wars--or rather in God's war against George Bush and the entire American 
  political, economic and religious state of mind). </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Education has always inspired 
    fear among those who want to keep the existing distribution of power and wealth 
    as they are. In my thirty years of teaching--I have often observed that fear. 
    And I think I understand what it is based on. The educational environment 
    is unique in our society: It is the only situation where an adult, looked 
    up to as a mentor, is alone with a group of young people for a protracted 
    and officially sanctioned period of time and can assign whatever reading he 
    or she chooses, and discuss with these young people any subject under the 
    sun. The subject may be defined by the curriculum...but this is a minor impediment 
    to a bold and imaginative teacher, especially in literature, philosophy and 
    the social sciences, where there are unlimited possibilities for free discussion 
    of social and political issues.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That would seem to be an educational 
    ideal, an arena for free discussion, assuming a diversity of viewpoints from 
    a variety of teachers, of the most important issues of our time. Yet it is 
    precisely that situation in the classrooms of higher education, which frightens 
    the guardians of the status quo.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They declare their admiration for 
    such freedom in principle, and suggest that radicals are insufficiently grateful 
    for its existence. But when teachers actually <i>use</i> this freedom, introducing 
    new subjects, new readings, outrageous ideas, challenging authority, criticizing 
    'Western civilization,' amending the 'canon' of great books as listed by certain 
    educational authorities of the past, then the self-appointed guardians of 
    'high culture' become enraged...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I taught American history, 
    I ignored the canon of traditional textbook, in which the heroic figures were 
    mostly presidents, generals and industrialists. In those texts wars were treated 
    as problems in military strategy and not in morality; Christopher Columbus 
    and Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt were treated as heroes in the march 
    of democracy, with not a word from the objects of their violence...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fundamentalists of politics...want 
    to pull the strings of control tighter on the distribution of wealth and power 
    and civil liberties. The fundamentalists of law...want to interpret the Constitution 
    so as to put strict limits on the legal possibilities for social reform. The 
    fundamentalists of education fear the possibilities inherent in the unique 
    freedom of discussion that we find in higher education.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so under the guise of defending 
    'the common culture'...or 'Western civilization,' they attack that freedom. 
    They fear exactly what some of us hope for, that if students are given wider 
    political choices in the classroom than they get in the polling booth or the 
    workplace, they may become social rebels. They may join movements for racial 
    or sexual equality, or against war, or, even more dangerous, work for what 
    James Madison feared as he argued for a conservative Constitution&quot; 'an

      all the most egregious violations of human rights in Communist or third 
      world countries. A similar myopic outlook is held by some members of university 
      faculties who are so enamored with left-wing thinking that anti-Communism 
      is still not considered to be intellectually respectable, whereas anticapitalism 
      is freely accepted...</p>

<p><font size="+1">The answer, of course, is that this <i>educational elite</i>, 
  more in keeping with the <i>Third Wave</i> than their detractors on the nationalistic 
  and economic-Right, understand in some purely secular sense, that <i>Judgment 
  must begin at the House of God</i>. And that: <i>Those to whom much has been 
  committed, much is required</i>. What has been committed to the West is not 
  only the Word of God itself but the force of history and the impulse of transformation, 
  and the skills and talents, and the spiritual resources to go with it. And therefore, 
  what God requires of those who have these things, along with the power of God's 
  own oracles in their possession, is Self-reflection and Self-correction--ATONEMENT. 
  These are essential to the great transformation that is about to take place 
  in the earth. Those on the Right must become painfully aware of the fact that 
  God is not an American, nor a Conservative (at least not in their sense of the 
  term), and therefore God is certainly NOT a capitalist. And in fact, it is the 
  Capitalist regime in America (with all of its social, religious, economic and 
  military implications) that is now standing directly in the pathway of God's 
  kingdom being realized in the earth. (Which is why God is rising up everywhere

    far out of proportion to the positive happenings and advances in America.

  Third Wave</i>. This timely work (outlining certain wave properties of history), 
  must be added to our present and collective sense of reality, to our overall 
  sense of the motion of historical time. It must be added to the equally valid 
  properties of the Dialectic theory--which also follow the lightning path of 
  history down the branches of the great World Tree--the kingdom of God being 
  the final synthesis; to Freud and Jung's psychological theories, with Vienna 
  itself appearing at the center of the Great and Universal Mandala of the Tree 
  of Life; and even to those aspects of the Great Man theory, being the culmination 
  to the cult of Nimrod in the earth, and which also lead to the manifestation 
  of God's truly anointed ones in our time. (The more we understand of reality,

<p><font size="+1">At the time William Jefferson Clinton was &quot;building a 
  bridge&quot; to the 21st century. It was his own philosophical, self-imaginative 
  attempt to assure the American people that he could shepherd them over the great 
  divide (the fiery moat), that separates the realm of man from the kingdom of 
  God. This <i>great man</i> (clearly &quot;great&quot; in his own estimation 
  of himself), could not deliver. Though his bridge would be built of words, and 
  even electrons, his metaphor was industrial. It was too weighed down by the 
  iron and steel, and by the old transmission lines, not only of America's oppressive 
  and destructive capitalistic and industrial past, but of Clinton's own natural 
  and fallen ways as well. Nevertheless, the <i>times, they were a'changing</i>, 
  rapidly. Everything was changing, right in front of him and everyone else. Gingrich 
  and company saw an opportunity here. They would &quot;catch the wave&quot; and 
  try to ride it across instead. Toffler wrote:</font></p>

    anguish, and disorientation can be traced directly to the conflict within

      rose to become America's highest ranking military officer, accepted President-elect 
      Bush's nomination as secretary of state Saturday, pledging to strengthen 
      U.S. alliances and stand firm against nations that practice terrorism.</p>
    <p>&quot;We will defend our interests from a position of strength,&quot; Powell 
      said.</p>
    <p>With tears in his eyes, Bush praised his first Cabinet pick as &quot;an 
      American hero, an American example and a great American story.&quot;</p>
    <p>Outlining his foreign policy priorities, Bush promised to use America's 
      &quot;unique power and unmatched influence&quot; to further the spread of 
      democracy and peace around the world...</p>
    <p>He pledged to work with countries like Russia and China, not as adversaries 
      but as strategic partners. He said the United States would stand firm with 
      its allies against nations that pursue weapons of mass destruction or sponsor 
      terrorism..</p>
    <p>&quot;I think these are promising times, times of great opportunity but

    constantly searching for a golden key to unlock all mysteries, simplify all 
    choices, and bring into intelligible relationship a bewildering variety of 
    attitudes and acts which, considered separately, appear to be a jumble of 
    paradoxes. Some among the searchers have sought to explain the United States 
    in terms of &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; the &quot;Frontier,&quot; or the 
    &quot;American Dream&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The enigma of Russia has long fascinated 
    the imagination of Russians and non-Russians alike. Attempted answers have 
    embraced such diverse explanations as the Russian Soul, the Great Plain, the 
    Third Rome, Infant Swaddling, Byzantinism, Barbarism, Geopolitics, Panslavism, 
    Muscovite Imperialism, Marxist Messianism...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since man is the animal who makes 
    ends of his means, his achievements often bear little resemblance to his intentions. 
    Many Russians in 1917 hailed the October Revolution in the name of the new 
    freedom, pure democracy, an end of exploitation and oppression, world unity 
    and peace, and the cooperative commonwealth of the classless society destined 
    to bring salvation to humanity. Their survivors or successors in 1955, while 
    still bewitched by heroic phrases, live in a highly stratified society under 
    a despotic and intolerant oligarchy in a world stubbornly refusing to be &quot;saved,&quot; 
    and therefore divided into the hostile camps of the Cold War. How did this 
    come out of that? This eternal question of the historian is answerable, if 
    at all, only in many thick volumes of record and analysis...I suspect, more 
    significant paradox may serve as a point of departure for the present brief 
    inquiry.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia's &quot;mission&quot; in 
    the minds of most Russian rulers, from Ivan the Terrible to Malenkov, has 
    been to &quot;save the West&quot; from its crimes and follies by leading it 
    back to the true faith and the good life. In borrowing the Western creed of 
    Marxism...Russia's revolutionary leaders were more determined than their forbears 
    to rescue the West, by example or World Revolution, from the evils of social 
    injustice. This purpose was no facile rationalization but a deep spiritual 
    conviction.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia's actual role in the world 
    society of our century has been of a wholly different order. Through totalitarian 
    dictatorship and socialist economic planning, the Marxist masters of Muscovy 
    have lifted Russia to the stature of a &quot;Super Power,&quot; and demonstrated 
    how a primitive community, through immense sacrifice and suffering, can raise 
    itself to the level of a highly industrialized, urbanized society. The demonstration 
    inspires loathing and fear in the wealthy West. But in the Eastern slum-lands 
    of the earth it evokes admiration and emulation. The message to the West falls 
    on deaf ears. It finds eager Oriental listeners, for whom it was never meant 
    in the wildest imaginings of Marx and Lenin. The causes and results of this 
    unintended reversal of roles is a major clue to foreign policy and domestic 
    developments in contemporary Russia...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the conclusion is not a certainty. 
    The United States is vastly wealthier, more powerful and more secure than 
    Russia. Americans nonetheless feel less secure than ever before in their national 
    experience and act accordingly in foreign policy. Russians may do likewise. 
    The possibility is enhanced by the fact that their creed imbues them with 
    a conviction, stronger than that of even the most ardent of &quot;world-saving&quot; 
    Americans, that their sacred mission is to &quot;liberate&quot; mankind through 
    conspiracy, subversion and, conceivably, an armed crusade. Aside from messianism, 
    which long antedates the Marxist era, Russia's rulers cling tenaciously, with 
    only a modicum of &quot;mellowing&quot; since Stalin's demise, to other antique 
    formulas for safety...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the grand design of Communizing 
    the world has no time-table...In their obsession with the &quot;American Menace,&quot; 
    they will strengthen, not unskillfully, their political, economic, and military 
    bonds with their European satellites and their Chinese ally... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Communist acquiescence in the <i>status

    the famous statement by Winston Churchill that Russian policy is &quot;a riddle

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever the suggestion is made 
    that the concept of national interest be applied as an explanation of Soviet

    The most vigorous protests come, of course, from Soviet sources. It is a standard 
    claim of Soviet spokesmen that their state is by definition something &quot;different&quot; 
    (or &quot;higher&quot;) and that the foreign policy of this entity is different 
    in principle from that of other states because the latter are capitalist and 
    the former is socialist. It would seem that only uncritical adherents of communism 
    could take such statements seriously. Yet non-Communists very often cite them...in 
    support of their own claim that the Soviet Union is indeed &quot;different,&quot; 
    though not in the way Soviet propaganda wants one to believe. The claim is 
    that the Soviet Union is, at best, &quot;a conspiracy disguised as a state&quot; 
    and cannot be viewed as a &quot;normal&quot; member of the world community

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monday, 2 December, 2002, BEIJING, 
    Dec. 2 -- The Russian and Chinese leaders traded effusive pledges of friendship 
    today as President Vladimir V. Putin made a quick but high-profile visit to 
    Beijing. &quot;China and Russia will be good neighbors, friends and partners 
    forever,&quot; President Jiang Zemin said as he met with the Russian leader 
    this morning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Putin, who arrived this morning 
    at 1:40 and leaves on Tuesday to continue an Asian tour, said he was &quot;fully 
    confident of a bright future for Russia-China relations.&quot; Since the collapse 
    of the Soviet Union, which had menaced China, Moscow and Beijing have worked 
    to rebuild friendly ties, in part to counterbalance the overwhelming global 
    power of the United States. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's summit meeting, which was 
    given prominent news media attention in both countries, seemed intended to 
    reassure each other of that commitment, even as both have drawn closer to 
    Washington. Mr. Putin is the most prominent foreign visitor since the change 
    in Communist Party leadership here last month. After meeting Mr. Jiang he 
    met with Hu Jintao, the newly selected party chief, and other top leaders. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Mr. Jiang, who will remain 
    as state president until March and has also kept his title as military chairman, 
    left little doubt that he remains the paramount leader. Today, in a reminder 
    of that status, he publicly informed Mr. Putin that he was sure that the Russian 
    leader and Mr. Hu would &quot;soon form good working relations.&quot; Mr. 
    Putin and Mr. Hu were scheduled to meet later. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the strategic shifts that followed 
    the terror attacks of Sept. 11, China and Russia, for strong political and 
    economic reasons, have each drawn closer to the United States. They have joined 
    in President Bush's global crusade against terror and kept quiet as the Americans 
    sent troops to central Asia. Both also went along, reluctantly, with an aggressive 
    American-sponsored United Nations resolution seeking to disarm Iraq, though 
    they remain nervous about independent American military action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in repeated comments today, 
    Chinese and Russian officials stressed their shared commitment to a &quot;multipolar&quot; 
    world -- code words for a world less dominated by the United States. They 
    declared their shared faith in the United Nations Security Council, where 
    both have veto power as permanent members, and their opposition to &quot;unilateral 
    action&quot; by any country. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One new bond the leaders mentioned 
    prominently today was a shared interest in stamping out Islamic separatism. 
    In words sure to please Mr. Putin, Mr. Jiang praised the Russian leader for 
    his &quot;just antiterrorism actions,&quot; including the recent deadly raid 
    on Chechen rebels who held hundreds of hostages in a Moscow theater. Mr. Putin 
    pledged renewed cooperation against Islamic movements in Central Asia and 
    Xinjiang Province in China. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a joint communiqu&eacute;, the 
    two governments spoke out against the acquisition of nuclear weapons by North 
    Korea, but also called on Washington to honor previous agreements with Pyongyang. 
    &quot;The sides consider it important for the destiny of the world and security 
    in Northeast Asia to preserve the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula 
    and the regime of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,&quot; said 
    the 14-page joint declaration, which did not set out new policies but was 
    notable for its strong emphasis on the unsettled situation on the Korean peninsula. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In this context,&quot; the 
    statement continued, the two sides &quot;stress the extreme importance of 
    normalizing relations&quot; between the United States and North Korea &quot;on 
    the basis of continued observation of earlier reached agreements, including 
    the framework agreement of 1994.&quot; In that agreement, North Korea promised 
    to halt nuclear weapons development in return for energy aid, including construction 
    of nuclear power plants. The agreement is in limbo following North Korean 
    admissions of covert nuclear research. China is one of North Korea's few allies 
    and does not want to see the country collapse, but its diplomats have also 
    been exasperated by the country's military posturing, which it fears could 
    destabilize the region. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's joint statement also called 
    for a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi weapons issue. It complained that some 
    governments have a &quot;policy of double standards&quot; on human rights 
    and rejected &quot;the use of human rights questions as a lever for pressure 
    in international relations.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China and Russia have repeatedly 
    pledged to bolster economic ties, and this year's trade between the two countries 
    is expected to reach $11 billion. That remains, however, a small fraction 
    of either country's trade with the West, which has the capital and technology 
    that both seek. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Russia does sell to China 
    is advanced weaponry, fighter jets and naval destroyers that are central to 
    the modernization of China's military. The countries are also negotiating 
    major deals to sell Russian oil and gas to China, which has growing import 
    needs and wants to diversify from Middle Eastern sources. With its arms and 
    energy purchases, China in turn provides Russia with badly needed hard currency. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year, at Beijing's urging, 
    the two countries signed a vague &quot;Good Neighborly Treaty of Friendship 
    and Cooperation.&quot; &quot;We're absolutely certain that the special strategic 
    relationship between Russia and China will not only enable us to solve the 
    problems facing our countries, but also will create the basis for stability 
    in the world,&quot; Mr. Putin said at a signing ceremony for the joint declaration.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monday 24 March 2003. WASHINGTON 
    (AFP) - US President George W. Bush scolded Russian President Vladimir Putin 
    over Russian firms' alleged sales of military equipment to Iraq, which could 
    imperil US-led forces in their drive to Baghdad. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White House said it had &quot;credible 
    evidence&quot; that the companies sold Iraq night-vision goggles, anti-tank 
    weapons, and technology to jam satellite signals that US-led forces could 
    use to guide bombs and military aircraft. &quot;It's the kind of equipment 
    that will put our young men and women in harm's way. It gives an advantage 
    to the enemy, an advantage we don't want them to have,&quot; US Secretary 
    of State Colin Powell told Fox News Channel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powell and US President George 
    W. Bush placed calls to their Russian counterparts, and Bush secured President 
    Vladimir Putin's pledge to &quot;look into&quot; the allegations, said White 
    House spokesman Ari Fleischer. The spokesman declined to say for sure whether 
    Iraqi forces were using the equipment in clashes with US, British and Australian 
    forces but said the material was &quot;not provided for the purpose of sitting 
    on shelves.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington had upbraided Moscow 
    &quot;over the past year&quot; about the alleged sales, culminating with Monday's 
    telephone calls, according to US officials, who say the transactions violate 
    UN-imposed sanctions. &quot;Frankly, we believe we've given them more than 
    enough information so that they should have been able to find out the truth 
    of this,&quot; Powell told Fox. &quot;So far, I am disappointed at the response.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia has denied the charges, 
    and the Kremlin account of the telephone conversation centered on Putin bluntly 
    warning Bush he must strive to avert a &quot;humanitarian catastrophe&quot; 
    tied to US-led military action in Iraq. &quot;Putin repeated his existing 
    position on resolving (the crisis over) Iraq and underlined the need to prevent 
    a humanitarian catastrophe in the region,&quot; the Kremlin said in a statement. 
    The warning came after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
    said that Basra's 1.2 million residents are on the brink of a humanitarian 
    crisis due to a water shortage and fighting around the southern Iraqi city. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mutual scolding appeared to 
    signal a deepening rift between the United States and Russia, which joined 
    France, Germany and China in firmly opposing US-led military action against 
    Iraq. The two leaders &quot;speak frankly to each other,&quot; Fleischer said, 
    using diplomatic code for sharp disagreements. &quot;There are problems. This 
    clearly is a problem that needs to be resolved.&quot; &quot;These actions 
    are disturbing, and we have made our concerns clear to the Russian government. 
    We've asked the Russian government that any such ongoing assistance cease 
    immediately,&quot; said Fleischer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the acrimonious UN debate 
    on a resolution backing war against Iraq, US officials have privately said 
    that commercial ties to Iraq go a long way toward explaining resistance to 
    the war from France and Russia. A top US official, speaking on condition of 
    anonymity, said Sunday that Washington had evidence that personnel from a 
    Russian firm were in Iraq attempting to help set up and operate a system that 
    interferes with US global positioning technology. Fleischer did not confirm

  But the implications should be clear. They explain to us the things we have 
  <i>not</i> been learning in school--from neither the Liberal or the Conservative 
  perspective (despite the Religious Right's insistence to the contrary). America 
  is moving toward a confrontation with the powers of the East, one that will 
  result in the fulfillment of the very words of the prophets which both sides 
  so systematically disregard (Revelation, chapter 18. KJV). For Liberals also 
  consider themselves to be &quot;good Americans,&quot; and keepers of the Sacred 
  Flame of Liberty. They also believe, perhaps even more than their Conservative 
  brethren, that they have divined the true intentions of the <i>Founding Fathers</i>, 
  and are just as willing to send the nation's young men and women away to die 
  in the interest of that world-view as those on the Right. And that is the crux 
  of the entire matter: Anyone who sends another person away to war, to kill and 
  to die in the name of Christianity, or who subscribes to it under the guise 
  of Christian ethics, is either an antichrist or subject to one. (And now, while 
  it is absolutely true that God has sent George Bush and the American armies 
  to the East as a judgment against the cruelties of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi 
  regime, indeed against the collective literal and violent impulses of the entire 
  Islamic world itself, the words still remain:</font></p>

  language men used to deceive themselves and others, as well as by the emerging 
  power and adventurous mystique of the capitalist spirit itself and the wide 
  open space to exploit. Of course the Church was deceived by its own natural 
  heart, by the preachers of Ba'al within its very own ranks, just as it is today. 
  Nevertheless, the American school system that has grown out of these wicked 
  associations, and the many various civic organizations that have direct access 
  to it, has routinely and systematically enforced and instilled the rule of American 
  law, along with the myths and precepts of the American socio-economic and military 
  order, into the hearts and minds of every child at its disposal ever since. 
  Christians are not allowed to pledge allegiance to any nation, and yet America's

    Britain and Argentina not only resurrects an old military feud. It also raises 
    a religious one. Christians have never agreed on issues of war and military 
    service. They probably never will. Since the beginning of the Church, Christian 
    thinking on the subject has been divided into two streams--Pacifism and the 
    Just Use of Force position. </font>(Between the spirit of Abel and the spirit

    </font>(Mr. Walker is absolutely correct in this matter)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Historically, the Pacifist position 
    has rested squarely on the Sermon on the Mount and the clear command of the 
    Lord Jesus Christ to <i>resist not evil</i>, and <i>turn the other cheek</i>. 
    BUT PACIFISM READS THE BIBLE TOO NARROWLY. It focuses on a few favored passages 
    to the exclusion of others. WE NEED TO EXAMINE THE FULL BREADTH OF THE SCRIPTURES. 
    </font>(With pleasure)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Violence clearly had no place in 
    Eden. But the Fall and the resulting rupture in human nature and human society 
    changed this. In the Old Testament, God commands the Israelites to occupy 
    the Promised Land by force. He, the Lord of Hosts (literally, &quot;of armies') 
    commands and sustains the military force that subdues Israel's enemies. </font>(Mr. 
    Walker is still without a clue. He does not know how to &quot;rightly divide 
    the Word of God&quot;--to distinguish epic narrative and allegory from historical 
    fact)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pacifist sometimes dismiss the 
    Old Testament wars by invoking the concept of Progressive Revelation--that 
    God revealed His holy character and law progressively through Biblical history...that 
    if God's full revelation had been present from the beginning, certain practices 
    would have been forbidden. </font>(Which, of course, is quite true. see Matthew 
    13:1-15)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God would not command something 
    that is intrinsically, inherently wrong, as James 1:13 says: &quot;God tempts 
    no man with evil.&quot; </font>(Nevertheless, see Ezekiel 20:19-26; 2 Thessalonians 
    2:7-12; Zephaniah 1:12; Micah 2:1-3; Amos 5:18...)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Thus, while they give no definitive answer, the Old Testament wars do lead 
    in a clear direction. In God's eyes it is possible for force to be used legitimately 
    by men and societies...The Lord Jesus used physical force when he cleansed 
    the temple (John 2:15). He moved against the established, but aberrant, religio-political 
    institution of his day. </font>(And therefore thine own words shall condemn

  which the Spirit had promised, and instead of a willingness to pay the price 
  of endurance (Hosea 6:1-3; Matthew 24:5-13; Hebrews 3:12-14), the American church 
  threw itself body and soul into the Second Wave. And it is now in severe danger 
  of being swept away with it if it continues to think in terms of the old paradigms 
  of (false) peace and (literal) war, and yield to the present rulers of this 
  age who have set themselves blindly and ignorantly in defense of this same old

<p><font size="+1"> They, the present rulers of this age, and those who express 
  their will, desire to keep us educated in these ways because they were brought 
  up these ways themselves. And because resistance and protest is an American 
  tradition, the people are allowed to protest and raise their banners, and have 
  their say (on almost every issue, including war)--as long as they do not begin 
  to make a <i>real</i> change in the American attitude, or begin to make a noticeable 
  tear in the national fabric. The entire nation together applauded that courageous 
  young man--that young Reagan capitalist--who stood defiantly in front of that 
  Chinese tank on Tiananmen Square, but let us begin to &quot;awaken&quot; together 
  as a people, and begin to educate each other in the ways of the Spirit, in the 
  ways of true universal righteousness (with all of its national, global and spiritual 
  implications), thus with the unfolding Revelation of God's designs upon this

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the United States today--as 
    in many countries--the collision of Second and Third Waves creates social 
    tensions, dangerous conflicts, and strange new political wave fronts that 
    cut across the usual divisions of class, race, sex, or party. </font>(The 
    children of the coming age belong to no &quot;party&quot;)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    This collision makes a shambles of traditional political vocabularies and 
    makes it very difficult to separate the progressives from the reactionaries, 
    friends from enemies. All the old polarizations and coalitions break up. Unions 
    and employers, despite their differences, join to fight environmentalists. 
    Blacks and Jews, once united in the battle against discrimination, become 
    adversaries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many nations, labor, which has 
    traditionally favored &quot;progressive&quot; policies such as income redistribution, 
    now often holds &quot;reactionary&quot; positions with respect to women's 
    rights, family codes, immigration, tariffs, or regionalism. The traditional 
    &quot;left&quot; is often pro-centralization, highly nationalistic, and antienvironmentalist.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time we see politicians, 
    from Valery Giscard d'Estaing to Jimmy Carter or Jerry Brown espousing &quot;conservative&quot; 
    attitudes toward economics </font>(and may we add, &quot;deceptive&quot; attitudes 
    toward &quot;war&quot; and &quot;peace&quot;)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and &quot;liberal&quot; attitudes toward art, sexual morality, women's rights, 
    or ecological controls. No wonder people are confused and give up trying to 
    make sense of their world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The media, meanwhile, report a 
    seemingly endless succession of innovations, reversals, bizarre events, assassinations, 
    kidnappings, space shots, governmental breakdown, commando raids, and scandals, 
    all seemingly unrelated. The apparent incoherence of political life is mirrored 
    in personality disintegration. Psychotherapists and gurus do a land-office 
    business; people wander aimlessly amid competing therapies, from primal scream 
    to 'est.' They slip into cults and covens or, alternatively, into a pathological 
    privatism, convinced that reality is absurd, insane, or meaningless. </font>(Toffler

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Every civilization has a 
    hidden code--a set of rules or principles that run through all its activities 
    like a repeated design. As industrialization pushed across the planet, its 
    unique hidden design became visible. </font>(Please read,<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    </font><i>Genocide Against the Indians, Its Role in the Rise of U.S. Capitalism</i>, 
    by George Novack). <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It consisted 
    of a set of six interrelated principles that programmed the behavior of millions. 
    Growing naturally out of the divorce of production and consumption, these 
    principles affected every aspect of life from sex and sports to work and war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of the angry conflict in our 
    schools, businesses, and governments today actually centers on these half-dozen 
    principles, as Second Wave people instinctively apply and defend them and 
    Third Wave people challenge and attack them...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STANDARDIZATION...The most familiar 
    of these Second Wave principles is standardization. Everyone knows that industrial 
    societies turn out millions of identical products. Fewer people have stopped 
    to notice, however, that once the market became important, we did more than 
    simply standardize Coca-Cola bottles and light bulbs...In Second Wave societies, 
    hiring procedures as well as work were increasingly standardized. Standardized 
    tests were used to identify and weed out the supposedly unfit, especially 
    in the civil service. Pay scales were standardized throughout whole industries, 
    along with fringe benefits, lunch hours, holidays, and grievance procedures. 
    </font>(But only after these things were won from the capitalist class through 
    intense soul-search and spiritual compromise, through great heroic efforts 
    and much personal suffering)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. TO 
    PREPARE YOUTH FOR THE </font>(Capitalist)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    JOB MARKET, educators designed standardized curricular. Men like Binet and 
    Terman devised standardized intelligence tests. School grading policies, admission 
    procedures, and accreditation rules were similarly standardized...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mass media, meanwhile, disseminated 
    standardizing imagery, so that millions read the same advertisements, the 
    same news, the same short stories...Different parts of the country began to 
    look alike, as identical gas stations, billboards, and houses cropped up everywhere. 
    The principle of standardization ran throughout every aspect of daily life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SPECIALIZATION...A second great 
    principle ran through all Second Wave societies: specialization. For the more 
    the Second Wave eliminated diversity in language, leisure, and life-style, 
    the more it needed diversity in the sphere of work...All sorts of occupational 
    groups from librarians to salesmen began clamoring for the right to call themselves 
    professionals--and for the power to set standards, prices, and conditions 
    of entry into their specialties. By now...'Our culture is dominated by professionals 
    who call us &quot;clients&quot; and tell us our &quot;needs.&quot;' </font>(Further 
    setting various groups of individuals apart from others, according to class 
    and economic distinctions, destroying the very fabric of every soul's common 
    humanity, and common purpose in life)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SYNCHRONIZATION...The widening 
    split between production </font>(whose means were now owned and controlled 
    by owners and controllers) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and consumption 
    also forced a change in the way Second Wave people dealt with time...Until 
    the Second Wave brought in machinery and silenced the songs of the worker, 
    most such synchronization of effort was organic or natural. It flowed from 
    the rhythm of the seasons and from biological processes, from the earth's 
    rotation and the beat of the heart. Second Wave societies, by contrast, moved 
    to the beat of the machine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As factory production spread, the 
    high cost of machinery and the close interdependence of labor required a much 
    more refined synchronization. If one group of workers </font>(producer/consumers...1984)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    was late in completing a task, others down the line would be further delayed. 
    Thus punctuality, never very important in agricultural communities, became 
    a social necessity, and clocks and watches began to proliferate...Not by coincidence, 
    children in industrial societies were taught to tell time at an early age. 
    PUPILS WERE CONDITIONED TO ARRIVE AT SCHOOL WHEN THE BELL RANG so that later 
    on they would arrive reliably at the factory or office when the whistle blew...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the Second Wave became dominant 
    even the most intimate routines of life were locked into the industrial pacing 
    system...families arose as one, ate at the same time, commuted, worked, returned 
    home, went to bed, slept, and even made love more or less in unison as the 
    entire civilization.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CONCENTRATION...First Wave societies 
    lived off widely dispersed sources of energy. Second Wave societies became 
    almost totally dependent on highly-concentrated deposits of fossil fuel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the Second Wave concentrated 
    more than energy. It also concentrated population, stripping the countryside 
    of people and relocating them in giant urban centers...While work in First 
    Wave societies took place everywhere--in the home, in the village, in the 
    fields--much of the work in Second Wave societies was done in factories where 
    thousands of laborers were drawn together </font>(to compete against each 
    other for the favor and blessings of the capitalist masters)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    under a single roof.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor was it only energy and work 
    that were concentrated...The early nineteenth century, in fact, has been called 
    the time of the Great Incarcerations--when criminals were rounded up and concentrated 
    in prisons, the mentally ill rounded up and concentrated in 'lunatic asylums,' 
    AND CHILDREN ROUNDED UP AND CONCENTRATED IN SCHOOLS, exactly as workers were 
    concentrated in factories...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MAXIMIZATION...The split-up of 
    production and consumption also created, in all Second Wave societies, a case 
    of obsessive 'macrophilia'--A KIND OF TEXAN INFATUATION WITH BIGNESS AND GROWTH...Such 
    faith in sheer scale derived from narrow Second Wave assumptions about the 
    nature of 'efficiency.'...Second Wave governments around the world entered 
    into a blind race to increase Gross National Product at all costs, maximizing 
    'growth' EVEN AT THE RISK OF ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL DISASTER. The macrophiliac 
    principle was built so deeply into the industrialized mentality that nothing 
    seemed more reasonable. Maximization went along with the other industrial 
    ground rules.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CENTRALIZATION...Finally, all industrialized 
    nations developed into a fine art. While the Church and many First Wave rulers 
    knew perfectly well how to centralize power, they dealt with far less complex 
    societies and were crude amateurs by contrast with the men and women who centralized 
    industrialized societies from the ground up...As industrialization pushed 
    the political system toward greater centralization, the government in Washington 
    took on an increasing number of powers and responsibilities and monopolized 
    more and more decision-making at the center. Within the federal government, 
    meanwhile, power shifted from the Congress and the courts to the most centralist 
    of the three branches--the Executive. By the Nixon years, historian Arthur 
    Schlesinger...was attacking the 'Imperial Presidency.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These (six) principles in turn, 
    each reinforcing the other, led relentlessly to the rise of bureaucracy. They 
    produced some of the biggest, most rigid, most powerful bureaucratic organizations 
    the world had ever seen, leaving the individual to wander in a Kafka-like 
    world of looming mega-organizations. If today we feel oppressed and overpowered 
    by them, we can trace our problems to the hidden code that programmed the 
    civilization of the Second Wave. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, indeed, are the Second Wave 
    elites who are still applying these rules--in business, in banking, in labor 
    relations, in government, IN EDUCATION, in the media. For the rise of a new 
    civilization challenges all the vested interests of the old one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the upheavals that lie IMMEDIATELY 
    ahead, the elites of all industrial societies--so accustomed to setting the 
    rules--will in all likelihood go the way of the feudal lords of the past. 
    Some will be by-passed. Some will be dethroned. Some will be reduced to impotence 
    or shabby gentility. Some--most intelligent and adaptive--will be transformed 
    and emerge as leaders of the Third Wave civilization. </font></p>

    tomorrow when the Third Wave becomes dominant, we must know exactly who runs 
    things today.&quot; </font>The Third Wave, pp.39-53.</p>

  <b>Yes, According To The Architects Of The New Global Economy<br>
  By Cindy Weatherly<br>
  12-7-03</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>During preparation for a workshop on educational policy in 1982, I was 
    asked by the host organization to prepare a glossary of terms pertaining to 
    my presentation. That request seemed simple enough and a reasonable one, so 
    I set about compiling terms related to CBE (Competency-Based Education) (forerunner 
    of Outcome-Based Education and promulgated by the same man Bill Spady), our 
    fad-of-the-moment in educational reformation toward illiteracy in Georgia. 
    As I said, the task seemed simple enough. However, while still in the &quot;A's&quot; 
    of the alphabet, I developed an overwhelming respect for professional compilers 
    of glossaries. The first word block I encountered was &quot;assessment&quot;. 
    Sure it was familiar; we all knew it meant 'test'; but the longer I struggled 
    to apply that definition to CBE the more elusive &quot;assessment's&quot; 
    definition became. <br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>The latest word for 'test' was &quot;instrument&quot; and that proved 
    easy to explain. But, &quot;assessment&quot; was a broader term, &quot;assessment&quot; 
    was the noun form of the verb &quot;assess&quot;. What did &quot;assess&quot; 
    actually mean? The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) had 
    been in use since its development in the latter 1960's. Had we overlooked 
    a change in emphasis by the Federal level of education implied by the use 
    of the word &quot;assessment&quot; that could be significant? Receiving no 
    help from my small hill of accumulated state department of education materials 
    relating to assessment, I decided to &quot;read the instruction manual&quot;: 
    (Webster's New World Dictionary.) Webster's clearly stated: </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;assess&quot;: 1. to set an estimated value on (property, etc.) for 
    taxation 2. to set the amount of (a tax, fine, damages, etc.) 3. to impose 
    a fine, tax, or special payment on (a person or property) 4. to impose (an 
    amount) as a fine, tax, etc. 5. to estimate or determine the significance, 
    importance, or value of; evaluate. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;assessment&quot;: 1. the act of assessing 2. the amount assessed. 
    This definition disturbed me a little. I had assumed that &quot;assessment&quot; 
    was just the latest educationese for a broad-based test. Had I missed something 
    somewhere? To accomplish the task at hand -- the glossary -- I crafted a definition 
    that read like this: <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Assessment: an estimation; determination of the significance or 
    value of. As used in education, a general term for measuring student progress. 
    Conflict in definition occurs when considering that this is a measurement 
    process that is used to determine the value or significance of a particular 
    outcome in educational performance. Therefore, it is not a true measurement, 
    but a process of assigning value to specific tasks, creating a cumulative 
    score for performance instead of an accurate measurement against a standard.&quot; 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>It sounded good at the time and spoke to the question of &quot;what are 
    we testing?&quot; which was a growing concern due to the nature of Competency-Based 
    Education's life role skills competencies, which were going to dictate our 
    educational goals -- just like &quot;OBE&quot; does today. Even though satisfied 
    to have introduced the idea that there may be a conflict within the definition 
    of &quot;assessment&quot; as an educational term, I was bothered that I could 
    find no definitions in other dictionaries, including legal ones, which did 
    not have primary meanings related to assigning a value for tax purposes. &quot;Assessment&quot; 
    is primarily a legal term; in fact, the use of the word &quot;instrument&quot; 
    could carry a legal connotation as well. Disturbing. <br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>THE FEDERAL ACCOUNTING PROCESS In March of 1984 I had the privilege of 
    giving testimony supporting stringent regulations for the Pupil Privacy Act 
    (the Hatch Amendment) which amended the General Education Provisions Act to 
    offer protection from intrusive questioning, programs, and the record-keeping 
    for parents and students. </b></p>
  <p><b>Again, preparation for that testimony caused me to review the National 
    Center for Educational Statistics' handbook series known as the &quot;State 
    Educational Records and Reports Series&quot;. Specifically, Handbook IIR - 
    the Financial Accounting Handbook - alluded to a &quot;unified accounting 
    system&quot; based on the process known as Planning, Programming and Budgeting 
    System (PPBS) which was to be used by all school systems. PPBS involves mandated 
    goals and constant adjustment of resources to ensure that goals are met... 
    the system that is still in use today. In testifying, I drew a projected conclusion: 
    <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>If our financial resource reporting is going to be unified by such a system, 
    then are we not but a step away from unified goals for our educational outcomes? 
    This is assuredly a step toward mandated national curriculum and interstate 
    and interregional tax and financial management revisions... will we not soon 
    be sharing tax resources from region to region as needed to `equalize' educational 
    opportunities and programs deemed `exemplary` or in the `national interest 
    to produce global- minded citizens?'</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Of 
    course the purpose of the Law and the Prophets IS to produce Global-Minded 
    Citizens. Do not, however, get the goals of the American system confused with

  </p>
  <p><b>The longer I thought of &quot;assessment&quot; being the &quot;value determined 
    for tax purposes&quot; and the possibility of cross-regional/state sharing 
    of tax resources, the more concerned I became over the idea that the record-keeping 
    and information-compiling might become so tied to the individual student that 
    &quot;assessment&quot; might have a more malignant potential. WE WERE TALKING 
    ABOUT OUR CHILDREN HERE. </b></p>
  <p><b>At that point in time there was a growing emphasis on choice and vouchers/tuition 
    tax credits in education. Since with the money flows the control, could this 
    be part of the &quot;assessment&quot; picture? That would tie an individual 
    student moving about in the &quot;choice market&quot; directly to a federal 
    accounting process both financially and educationally due to national standards 
    being proposed. No one seemed to be too worried about it in the 1980's, but 
    it still bothered me. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Over a period of time I shared my concern with close associates -- if 
    &quot;assess&quot; was to &quot;assign a value for tax purposes&quot;, then 
    why were we &quot;assessing&quot; children? A theory began to take root and 
    grow in my mind: somehow we were going to allow children's potential worth 
    to society to be measured, and their future life roles would somehow be measured, 
    and their future life roles would be somehow projected, and they would be 
    limited by that assigned worth. What a thought! Could this be possible in 
    the United States [of America]? <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>HUMAN CAPITAL DEFINED Later someone sent me pages from a book entitled 
    Human Capital and America's Future, edited by David W. Hornbeck and Lester 
    M. Salamon. The title itself set off alarm bells because of the connection 
    to education shared by many of the contributors, especially Hornbeck. It was 
    now the early 90's and many disturbing things were happening. David Hornbeck 
    was a highly visible change agent responsible for many radical education reforms 
    in states from Kentucky to Iowa and had been a consultant to many more. Why 
    was Hornbeck focusing on 'human capital'? That had been primarily used in 
    economic and commercial literature. Hornbeck was also identified with changes 
    in &quot;assessment&quot; in the school systems with which he consulted and 
    worked. The book was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1991 and 
    contains an enlightening list of contributors in addition to Hornbeck: Ernest 
    Boyer; Nancy Barrett; Anthony Carnavale; Sheldon Danziger; Marian Wright Edelman; 
    Scott Fosler; Daniel Greenberg; Jason Jaffras; Arnold Packer; Isabel Sawhill; 
    Marion Pines; Donald Stewart, and Lester Salamon. </b></p>
  <p><b>The social and political views of &quot;Human Capitol's&quot; line-up 
    of contributors could be the basis of another whole article, but suffice it 
    to say that most of the radical changes toward a managed populus in this country 
    can be reflected among this group of individuals. Weren't some of them involved 
    in the dis-establishing of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare 
    (HEW) and turning it into the Department of Education? <br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>While references to &quot;human capital&quot; have been the fare of business 
    publications for some time, it has only been in the last few years that this 
    term applied to school children. In Hornbeck's chapter in &quot;Human Capital&quot;, 
    'New Paradigm for Action', he outlined the systemic change which must occur 
    to produce the workforce for the future and fulfill our nation's 'human capital' 
    needs. Hornbeck's &quot;new paradigm of action&quot; looked a lot like old 
    &quot;OBE&quot; -- setting specific performance standards and invoking penalties 
    for schools, teachers and students not meeting them: <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;If the new comprehensive system is to be outcome-based, careful 
    attention must be paid to 'assessment' strategies. The selection of outcome 
    indicators will be informed by the availability of sound assessment instruments.&quot; 
    [emphasis added] Now here was Hornbeck using &quot;assessment&quot; and &quot;instrument&quot; 
    together instead of a substitute for one or the other -- and he had selected 
    the two terms which carried legal usage definitions. Hornbeck asserted that 
    while the NAEP might be universally available, and portfolio &quot;assessments&quot; 
    (notice the use of both words together) would become popular, &quot;the Educational 
    Testing Service (ETS) is investing time and funds in developing new approaches 
    to assessment.&quot; He further stated that while most of the present 'assessment' 
    observations are &quot;related to academic objectives&quot;... <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Similar sensitivity is required in carefully defining appropriate 
    assessment tools in other areas as well. In citizenship... a method should 
    be developed for expressing qualitative aspects of participation activities... 
    a different 'value' could be placed on 'community service'... physical and 
    mental fitness... problems arise as we confront legal and even constitutional 
    issues (self-incrimination, search and seizure)... Perhaps a school system 
    should plan to have all students undergo a &quot;physical exam&quot; in the 
    fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades as a health counterpart to the academic 
    testing program. Again, the emphasis must be on carefully determining assessment 
    strategies that measure the outcomes to be achieved.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>All of this is structured because &quot;incremental change is insufficient. 
    Systems must be radically altered to produce what the nation's economy demands 
    in a work force.&quot; Weren't we supposed to be concerned about the education 
    of school children? This sounded a lot like literature which proposed &quot;full 
    employment&quot; policies -- much like the billboards and signs plastered 
    on public transportation and public buildings in Grenada -- &quot;Work for 
    everyone; everyone working!&quot; -- before the U.S. invasion to overthrow 
    their communist government. Was this why the Council of Chief State School 
    Officers accepted a contract from the National Center for Educational Statistics 
    to develop what is known as the &quot;SPEEDE ExPRESS? (The Exchange of Permanent 
    Records Electronically of Students and Schools.) THIS ELECTRONIC INFORMATION 
    TRACK CAN CARRY THE MOST DIVERSE AND EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ON A STUDENT, DELIVERING 
    IT TO FUTURE EMPLOYERS, PLACES OF HIGHER EDUCATION, TRAINING CENTERS, HEALTH 
    PROVIDERS (contraceptive histories will be included), THE MILITARY AND A NUMBER 
    OF OTHER RECIPIIENTS YET TO BE DESIGNATED. Then if employers, government and 
    others have input into what should be the outcome of education in this country 
    -- instead of education being academically and informational-based -- then 
    the concept of &quot;assessment as assigning a value&quot; to a child takes 
    on proportions that are certainly Orwellian. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>What if your child's &quot;assessed&quot; worth doesn't meet anyone's 
    projected goal? Proponents of the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and 
    the Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) ARE, IN TRUTH, FLESHING OUT THE 
    SKELETON OF ASSIGNING VALUE TO A PERSON. Without the CIM/CAM in those states 
    adopting the concept a young person will not be able to apply for a job, drive 
    a car, or do many other things which have never before been predicated on 
    governments' conferring a value on a person's worth to society. The People's 
    Republic of China, a communist country, uses &quot;no conformity -- no job&quot; 
    policies to enforce its &quot;one child&quot; policy. Have we understood the 
    direction of these changes? Is this constitutional or moral? <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>ASSESSING HUMAN VALUE The next piece to the puzzle of assessment fell 
    into place when my suspicions were confirmed that we really were assessing 
    &quot;value&quot;. The August 1993 issue of &quot;Visions&quot;, the newsletter 
    of the Education for the Future Initiative sponsored by Pacific Telesis Foundation, 
    was given out at a legislative committee meeting as part of a packet of information 
    on technology in the classroom and school-to-work transition activities. The 
    lead article was Beyond the Bubble with a blurb reading: &quot;Educators are 
    finding that new ways of teaching require new forms of 'assessment'.&quot; 
    On page three there was a column entitled 'Authentic Definitions'. Finally, 
    I thought, I have found an educational publication that will define this word 
    and allay my fears. Sure enough, there was the word: &quot;Assessment - The 
    act or result of judging the 'worth' or 'value' of something or 'someone'. 
    The worth or value of something or someone?! </b></p>
  <p><b>This was confirmation that educational testing had taken an extreme left 
    turn. It was not comforting to realize that our children were going to be 
    assigned a value based on &quot;acceptable performance behaviors in life-role 
    applications&quot; as proposed in PacTelesis Foundation's 'Authentic Definitions'. 
    Knowing that: <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>1) Our children would be tracked and that extensively detailed would be 
    electronically compiled and transmitted to select file-users; <br>
    2) Information would include or be based on a value level assigned to them 
    contingent upon performance - as a child - of life-role competencies; <br>
    3) Value levels could reflect the scale of achievement outlined in the United 
    States Labor Department's 1993 &quot;Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary 
    Skills&quot; [SCANS] -- which encompasses personality traits and private preferences, 
    and <br>
    4) The purpose of education has documentably been diverted into workforce 
    training, led me ultimately to the conclusion that indeed the future holds 
    a less than bright prospect for our young people. To be formally assigned 
    a &quot;worth&quot; to society based on your ability as a child to demonstrate 
    that you can perform an &quot;essential skill&quot; should be a foreign concept 
    in a constitutional republic like the one in which we live -- these United 
    States of America. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>An example of how these efforts at &quot;assessment&quot; have been perverted 
    to the ends outlined above is given in &quot;Crucial Issues In Testing&quot;, 
    edited by Ralph W. Tyler and Richard M. Wolf. This book is one in a series 
    prepared under the auspices of the National Society for the Study of Education, 
    which in 1974 included names like William Spady, John Goodlad, and Robert 
    Havighurst on its governing committee. On page 98, within an article by Carmen 
    J. Finley (of the American Institute for Research) is a section entitled &quot;Defining 
    Goals versus Comparison With an Average:&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;In the National Assessment program specific objectives or goals 
    are defined and exercises are written which determine how well these goals 
    are being met. For example, in citizenship a major objective is to `Support 
    Rights and Freedoms of All Individuals.' One specific way in which a person 
    might meet this goal is to defend the right of a person with very unpopular 
    views to express his opinion and support the right of `extreme' (political 
    or religious) groups to express their views in public.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Is 
    the author about to reveal her own dark side here)?</font><b><br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>One exercise which was written to try to tell whether or not this objective 
    was being met is as follows: <br>
    &quot;Below are three statements which make some people angry. Mark each statement 
    as to whether you think a person on radio or TV should or should not be allowed 
    to make these statements: * = Russia is better than the United States. * = 
    Some races of people are better than others. * = It is not necessary to believe 
    in God.&quot; This is the goal-oriented approach. The objectives or goals 
    represent a kind of standard which is considered desirable to achieve. The 
    exercises, if they are good measures, tell to what extent the goals are being 
    achieved. This approach tells very specifically what a person knows or can 
    do. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>I submit that the goals-oriented/performance-based /OBE/assessment approach 
    just outlined tells more than what a child knows or can do. This approach 
    very specifically reveals what a child feels and believes. Remember that &quot;assessments&quot; 
    measure toward predetermined outcomes. Those outcomes represent the judged 
    &quot;worth&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of your children and mine! With the 
    last election cycle hope swept the country that a conservative majority had 
    exerted itself; changes would be made. As a country we'd be snatched from 
    the brink of economic socialism and potential corporate fascism; and sanity 
    would be restored to the halls of government. Right? <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>WHEN RIGHT IS LEFT It just happens that the October 1992 edition of Visions 
    (PacTelesis Foundation newsletter) contained an article entitled &quot;Why 
    Technology?&quot; It began, &quot;Alvin Toffler, the author of such influential 
    books as &quot;Future Shock&quot; and &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, has written 
    that the spread of personal computers is the single most important change 
    in the field of knowledge since the invention of movable type in the 15th 
    century. He goes on to state that knowledge is the key to power in the 21st 
    century -- not mineral rights or military force.&quot; This was the same publication 
    that carried the definitive definition of &quot;assessment&quot;. And wasn't 
    this the same Alvin Toffler who wrote &quot;Creating A New American Civilization&quot;, 
    which heralds the coming third wave of global culture, published by the Progress 
    and Freedom Foundation and introduced at their 'Cyberspace and the New American 
    Dream' conference in Atlanta last year? Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of 
    the House, introduced Toffler as his longtime friend and then sat quietly 
    by to hear Toffler say that national sovereignty was a thing of the past and 
    that he was an avowed secularist. These are the stripes of our new &quot;conservative&quot; 
    future? <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>At the same Cyberspace conference, an array of professionals from many 
    areas of cultural life paraded their contributions to leadership toward the 
    much-touted Third Wave. The spokesperson for education in Progress and Freedom 
    Foundation's lineup was -- and still is -- Lewis J. Perelman, author of &quot;School's 
    Out: A Radical New Formula for the Revitalization of America's Educational 
    System&quot;. Perelman advocates what he calls just-in-time learning, privatized 
    public schools, total quality applications, hyperlearning, and many other 
    catchy concepts which are now, of course, getting much attention in the policy 
    debate. <br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>It should be noted that in the Preface to his book Perelman cites Wassily 
    Leontief and B.F. Skinner among those from whom he particularly benefited 
    during his years at Harvard in the 70's. Most interesting since Leontief is 
    the acknowledged expert on management by objectives (MBO) -- the forerunner 
    and companion to PPBS. And Skinner was the American father of behavioral psychology, 
    and mastery learning/operant conditioning -- the foundation for OBE. These 
    relationships of Perelman's are important because he supplied the connecting 
    piece to complete the puzzle picture of our children's future. Perelman states 
    on page 316 that. . . &quot;Nostalgic mythology about `local control' should 
    not mask the reality that the state governments have the constitutional authority, 
    call the shots, and pay most of the bill for education. But government, local 
    or otherwise, no longer needs to own and operate school systems or academic 
    institutions.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>TAXING HUMAN WORTH Now, to the heart of Perelman's alternative proposal 
    which forms the future of &quot;conservative&quot; educational policy and 
    expresses &quot;assessment's&quot; future use: &quot;One possibility would 
    be a 'human capital tax'. The human capital tax might be simply the same as 
    a personal income tax, or might be calculated or ear-marked in a more limited 
    way. Technicalities aside, it's logical that if the government is going to 
    help fund investments in the development of the community's human capital, 
    taking back a share of the resulting gains is a good way to pay for it. In 
    effect, each generation of beneficiaries of such investment pays back some 
    of the benefits it received to the next generation&quot; [value-added tax, 
    ed.] (p. 317) <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;We should deal with parents who are 'starving their children's minds' 
    with the same legal remedies we use to deal with parents who are starving 
    their children's bodies. The... media through which a microchoice [voucher] 
    system is provided will give public authorities more accurate information 
    on what individual families and kids are doing than is currently available, 
    making it easier to identify instances of negligence or misuse.&quot; (page 
    318 [emphasis added] &quot;...there's no good reason why the learner should 
    not be able to purchase services or products from any provider -- whether 
    public or private, in-state or out-of-state.&quot; (p. 319) <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>A VALUE ADDED TAX FOR HUMAN WORTH There is the framework. A value-added 
    tax process that will &quot;deduct&quot; from a services/education super-voucher 
    a tax for every level of achievement/skill a student achieves -- true 'assessment'. 
    Standards will be rigid and penalties for non-achievement will be enforceable 
    against the student, his parents, and providers of educational services in 
    order to achieve a trained workforce.&quot; The implications for families 
    being disrupted by accusations and prosecutions for Perelman's implied abuse 
    and neglect over &quot;parental starving of children's minds&quot; are startling 
    in their flagrancy. An elaborate and accurate system will track families and 
    students, leaving privacy and confidentiality in the dust. The tax/voucher 
    will follow the student across state and regional boundaries, necessitating 
    a reformulation of tax bases; this could even be extended to foreign sources 
    -- Facilitated by choice and charter school initiatives. (Remember Toffler 
    asserts that national sovereignty is or will soon be a thing of the past. 
    And what about GATT's education provision?) <br>
    </b> </p>
  <p><b>The World Bank has just announced (Associated Press, &quot;The Des Moines 
    Register&quot;, 9/15/95) its new formula for estimating a nation's worth. 
    Ismael Serageldin, World Bank vice president for environmentally sustainable 
    development, stated in 'Monitoring Environmental Progress: A Report on Work 
    in Progress' that the system &quot;for the first time folds a country's people 
    and its natural resources into its overall balance sheet.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>While the World Bank projects that its new system of measuring wealth 
    which &quot;attempts to go beyond traditional gauges&quot; and lists &quot;Human 
    Resources: value represented by people's productive capacity&quot; (e.g. education, 
    nutrition) will take years to perfect, I submit that our process of 'assessment' 
    is a giant step in that direction. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>I am reminded that in May of 1984 the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published 
    an article entitled &quot;Industrial Policy Urged for GOP.&quot; The Institute 
    for Contemporary Studies, &quot;founded by Edwin Meese, Caspar Weinberger 
    and other Reagan Supporters&quot;, issued a report that advocated &quot;Republicans 
    shed some of their deep-rooted antipathy to a planned economy.&quot; All signals 
    seem to point to the fact that this has indeed happened. Somewhere in all 
    of this is lost the ability to communicate our culture in an organized way 
    and to teach basic skills that can be used whether cyberspace technology is 
    available or not. Didn't we used to call this &quot;education&quot;? Didn't 
    we believe that our children had some choice in their futures? When is 'assessment' 
    really 'assessment'? Ernest Boyer, former Director of the Office of Education 
    and Carnegie Foundation director, once said, &quot;To be fully human one must 
    serve.&quot; In the future to be fully assessed may mean our Children's worth 
    as a &quot;servant&quot; of the state will be &quot;assigned a value for tax 
    purposes.&quot; <br>
