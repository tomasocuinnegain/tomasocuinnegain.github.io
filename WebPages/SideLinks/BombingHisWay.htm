<p align="center"><b>Malachi, chapter 4; James, chapter 5...(KJV).</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The question we must answer is this: &quot;Is 
  history the work of man, or the work of God?&quot; If it is the work of man, 
  the universe is out of control, Chaos reigns. If it is the work of man, then 
  indeed, it is <i>The End of History, </i> what we see is what man has come to 
  and the neocons have as much <i>natural</i> right to attempt to impose their 
  own Darwinian order on the world as anyone else. If God has truly left these 
  affairs in the hands of man as the Deists believed in 1776, then there is no 
  hope but fleeting hope. It means there is no final synthesis, at least not in 
  our time, and (lamentation upon lamentation), Augustine was right, the theology 
  of Rome is correct and James Earl Carter (and others of his stature in the earth), 
  are indeed men for our time. If it is all the work of God, however, then the 
  Darkness will suddenly be dispelled and chaos will result in order. Out of Great 
  Darkness, GREAT LIGHT.</font></p>

    1:3). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Political and Religious Right labors under the severe delusion 
  that God is on their side. These children of Ba'al cannot begin to imagine how 
  the One God who rules over all, has brought both history and them to this moment 
  in time in order to reveal to the whole world what He will do in any future 
  attempt to return to the social, political, economic and religious conditions 
  that prevail over the earth today, over which He is now rising up to destroy. 
  <i>I have laid a snare for thee O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art 
  found and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord...</i>(Jeremiah 
  50:22-24)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Left on the other hand, thinks of God in the abstract and 
  has little reverence for the <i>reality</i> of God's existence. It has little 
  use for the words of the prophets and in turn faults God (mostly unwittingly) 
  for the present state of the world. It can see evil (in part, and particularly 
  in the present rulers of America), but believes this sight is an inherent quality 
  of its own natural goodness. The Left (disconnected from the heart of Reality), 
  is tangled up in its own intellect and basically believes that it would understand 
  the things that it does, even if God had not gone to all the historic efforts 
  to reveal it to them and to create it in them. The Left believes that it has 
  no hand in the great evils that have been perpetrated upon the world by America 
  in the name of God. And it naively believes that the liberal-leftist mind alone, 
  without the assistance of the Higher world (and particularly through the present 
  political process), is capable of solving the overwhelming dilemmas that beset 
  humankind in (now) the 21st century.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> (However, though lacking a vision of the Divine Chariot, without 
  historical perspective [an understanding of the forces of Creation that have 
  brought us to the present state of the world, or an idea of where all of it 
  is leading], we have, nevertheless, a timely, ground level look at the present 
  political and religious order in America, one that God it is certain would have 
  us share. An appeal to Christ's Sermon on the Mount, a most excellent place 
  to begin, it lays groundwork for the conversation we must have in our time).</font></p>

  of all the breaches of faith, Bush's usurpation of God to advance his political 
  agenda is perhaps the most heinous of his sins. By asserting that he can better 
  discern God's will than the leaders of his own faith (Methodist), his father's 
  faith (Episcopalian), his brother's faith (Catholic), and the leaders of virtually 
  every denomination in the United States, short of the Southern Baptists and 
  Evangelicals, Bush is committing the ultimate arrogance. They all oppose the 
  war that Bush claims is being committed in the name of God and Jesus. Bush stands 
  virtually alone in claiming that God is on the side of his little war.</b></p>

<p><b>SHOCK AND AWE</b></p>
<p><b>We've already experienced the Bush Cartel &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; here 
  in the homeland. No we haven't been hit with 3,000 missiles and bombs in 48 
  hours. That's not the kind of &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; inflicted upon us. </b><b>No, 
  the &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; that has rained down upon Americans is a bombardment 
  of lies and propaganda that has become so commonplace that is now banal to hear 
  another Bush Cartel politically motivated mistruth.</b></p>
<p><b>It is hard to keep track of the morally repugnant use of ginned up terror 
  alerts and the manipulative use of fear to achieve political goals. It is hard 
  to keep track of the ever-changing public relations explanations Bush uses to 
  justify bombing Iraq and setting up a neo-colonial American outpost there. It 
  is hard to keep track of the Grand Canyon gap between Bush's public image of 
  &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; and his actual gutting of the social 
  service support system for the elderly, children, the poor and the middle class 
  in America.</b></p>
<p><b>We have been &quot;Shocked and Awed&quot; by the daily avalanche of big 
  and little lies. The administration is the ultimate Hollywood production, where 
  nothing you see or hear represents the reality of what is going on behind the 
  set. </b><b>As we said, the very naming of the inferno that will be created 
  by the Bush Cartel in Baghdad -- &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; -- symbolizes how 
  the Bush Cartel is, in its own mind, assuming God like powers.</b></p>

<p><b>...The claim of &quot;moral clarity&quot; by the likes of Bush, Ashcroft, 
  and Tom DeLay is perhaps the most hypocritical of the hypocrisies of the Republican 
  Party. There is no &quot;moral clarity&quot; to the Bush Cartel: only the assertion 
  of a mandate from what clearly must be a renegade God, who appears closer to 
  the Anti-Christ, as evidenced by the deeds of Bush, than to the God of the Bible.</b></p>
<p><b>If this is, as Bush and Blair proclaim, a &quot;just war,&quot; then why 
  does the Bush Cartel have to intimidate, threaten, bully and bribe national 
  leaders to support it? This is, as they say in the &quot;juice loan&quot; enforcement 
  racket, a muscle job, not a mission mandated by God. (See &quot;The Muscle Beach 
  Party&quot; at http://www.buzzflash.com/editorial/03/01/23.html)</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/BushSyndicate.gif" width="500" height="321"></p>
<p><b>So it is not surprising that the actual Guernica-style bombing of Iraq is 
  meant to intimidate more than Iraqis and more than Muslim countries. It is meant 
  to be a warning sign to our allies that there's a made-in-the-White-House vehicle 
  loaded with enough firepower to destroy the earth careening down the highway 
  of the world. A dry drunk (GWB) is at the wheel, with a car full of passengers 
  besotted by absolute power </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1 
  Thessalonians 5:1-9)</font><b>, shouting instructions into his ear. The display 
  of &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; in Iraq is meant to signal to anybody who might 
  think about crossing Fredo and the Corleone/Bush family that the Bush Cartel 
  truck loaded with nuclear and conventional explosives might speed into any independent-minded 
  country at any time.</b></p>
<p><b>The perverse assumption of God-like powers in the &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; 
  attack is also meant to send a chill of fear down the spines of dissenters in 
  America. The Bush Cartel will stop at nothing, the pulverizing attack on Iraq 
  is meant to tell us. &quot;We will assert power absolutely. We will roll over 
  you. We will do what it takes to stay in power.&quot; That is what it is meant 
  to show us here in the homeland. When Richard Perle called investigative journalist 
  Seymour Hersh a terrorist on CNN, as he did on March 9th, you know that the 
  arrest of U.S. citizens in the name of fighting terrorism is not far behind. 
  As Daniel Ellsberg warned BuzzFlash.com in our interview with him, we are just 
  one terrorist attack away from a dictatorship-like government being written 
  into law. With its attack on Iraq, the Bush Cartel knows that it will probably 
  provoke at least one or more terrorist attacks in the U.S.</b></p>
<p><b>In the election of 2000, the mantra of the Bush post-election Florida team 
  was &quot;bring it on home&quot; no matter what tactics were required -- legal 
  or illegal, ethical or unethical, honest or dishonest. There wasn't a thought 
  about morality or democracy. </b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/BushAndOrwell.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p>
<p><b>Most of us worship a God of justice, a God who urges honesty and compassion. 
  But in the case of the Bush Cartel, given its Orwellian underpinnings, everything 
  about the war on Iraq is the opposite of what is preached by Jesus. In the world 
  of the Bush Cartel truth is translated into lies; humility is translated into 
  arrogance; compassion for the poor is translated into contempt; peace is translated 
  into war. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(This is exactly what 
  God would have us see)</font><b>.</b></p>
<p><b>One of the great ironies of the Iraq war buildup is that the Bush Cartel 
  is betting that Saddam does not actually have any Weapons of Mass Destruction 
  (WMD). Yes, the Bush Cartel sell-job to the American public and the world is 
  to claim Saddam is busting his gut with WMD's. But it is one of the great farces 
  of modern times that the U.S. intelligence agencies can't prove or find the 
  location of what they claim exists. So they are banking on the fact that their 
  real intelligence is correct: the madman of Iraq has no or little WMD inventory 
  left. In that case, American casualties will be &quot;minimal&quot; and the 
  Bush Cartel is counting on a decisive victory drowning out any other concerns 
  about the war (such as civilian casualties).</b></p>
<p><b>We know that references to Nazi Germany tend to marginalize arguments against 
  Bush among most Americans. But read these quotes and deny that they have relevance 
  to the current Bush Cartel propaganda strategy about the Iraq war:</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;I shall give a propaganda reason for starting the war. Never mind 
  whether it is plausible or not. The victor will not be asked afterward whether 
  he told the truth or not. In starting and waging war it is not right that matters, 
  but victory.</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence 
  is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these 
  facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must 
  harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what 
  you want him to understand by your slogan. As soon as you sacrifice this slogan 
  and try to be many-sided, the effect will piddle away, for the crowd can neither 
  digest nor retain the material offered. In this way the result is weakened and 
  in the end entirely cancelled out....The function of propaganda is, for example, 
  not to weigh and ponder the rights of different people, but exclusively to emphasize 
  the one right which it has set out to argue for. Its task is not to make an 
  objective study of the truth, in so far as it favors the enemy, and then set 
  it before the masses with academic fairness; its task is to serve our own right, 
  always and unflinchingly.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>This was what Hitler said in 1939 prior to invading Poland and his words 
  from Chapter Six of &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; That is not to say that the Bush 
  administration is morally equivalent to the Third Reich, but the fact remains 
  that they utilize similar propaganda strategies.</b></p>

<p><b>The Bush Cartel is counting on a &quot;successful&quot; outcome of this

<p><b>So have we really been transported back to the 12th century A.D. with Bush 
  as Richard the Lionhearted and Osama/Saddam as Saladin in a replay of the Third 
  Holy Crusade?</b></p>
<p><b>White House staffers have told journalists that Bush believes God chose 
  him to lead the nation through its hour of darkness. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2 
  Thessalonians, chapter 2...KJV).</font><b> Indeed, shortly after September 11th, 
  Bush used the term Crusade to describe his war against terrorism. In a September 
  24, 2001, editorial, BuzzFlash.com commented: &quot;Although the White House 
  apologized for Bush's evocation of the 'Crusade,' the propaganda damage had 
  already been done. If we are simultaneously trying to crush extremist Islamic 
  terrorists while minimizing the possibility of the Middle East and parts of 
  Islamic Asia from exploding in an armed uprising, then Bush's use of the word 
  'Crusade' was like tossing a match onto a tinder box when the use of a fire 
  extinguisher should have been the rhetorical tool of the day.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>But the reality is that Bush's notion of being chosen by God implies that 
  he is imparted with divine knowledge that others don't have. As a divinely chosen 
  leader, Bush believes that he is accountable to no one. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(It 
  is true. We are accountable because our minds are open to accountability. Bush 
  has had no such awakening)</font><b>. He has shown utter contempt for Congress 
  and the democratic election process. That is because Bush believes that they 
  are unnecessary because only he is hot wired into the Lord's intentions. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(I 
  will choose their delusions...Isaiah 66:4-9)</font><b><b>.</b></b></p>
<p><b>In Woodward's suffocatingly fawning book, Bush sniffs, &quot;I don't need 
  to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being the President. 
  Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel 
  like I owe anybody an explanation.&quot; Of course, Kings could make mistakes 
  and they would remain kings. They didn't, indeed, have to explain themselves 
  to anyone. When you lose an election and are appointed by the Supreme Court, 
  maybe you have to a right to view your ascension as divinely inspired. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Quite 
  so)</font>. </p>
<p><b>Bush may, no doubt, believe that he is heir to the great thrones of Europe, 
  when kings viewed themselves as rulers by divine right.</b></p>

<p><b>King James VI of Scotland, who later became King James I of England, having 
  ascended to the throne in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth, was one 
  of the better-known proponents of the notion of the divine right of kings. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Ezekiel,

  for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, 
  but even by God himself are called gods. There be three principal similitudes 
  that illustrate the state of monarchy: one taken out of the word of God; and 
  the two other out of the grounds of policy and philosophy. In the Scriptures 
  kings are called gods, and so their power after a certain relation compared 
  to the divine power. Kings are also compared to fathers of families: for a king 
  is truly Parens patriae, the politique father of his people. And lastly, kings 
  are compared to the head of this microcosm of the body of man.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>When James II angered his countrymen by attempting to restore Roman Catholicism 
  in England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 put an end to the rule of the House 
  of Stuarts and dealt the notion of divine right a major blow. It still existed 
  in France, however, where the reign of Louis XIV was rooted in the divine-right 
  doctrine; the remark &quot;L'etat, c'est moi&quot; (I am the state) is attributed 
  to him. It is widely believed that the death of this doctrine occurred in the 
  late 18th century. During the Enlightenment period &#150;- and as exemplified 
  most clearly in the French Revolution &#150;- more democratic ideas held sway 
  and the concept of an absolute monarch, let alone one appointed by God, became 
  part of a mythic past. </b></p>
<p><b>And yet the doctrine was once again championed in the early 1900s by the 
  German Emperor Wilhelm II as king of Prussia, and by Czar Nicholas II of Russia. 
  And once again, apparently, by Bush.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><a href="TheDarkRing.htm">One Ring to Rule Them All</a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Yes, it has taken the madness of King George to restore a concept of divine 
  rule that most scholars thought had been abandoned to the dust heap of history. 
  During his March 6th news conference -- and on previous occasions -- Bush has 
  referred to &quot;my government,&quot; echoing Louis XIV (&quot;I am the state&quot;). 
  Citizens of America expressing their opinions are just focus groups to King 
  George. Royal court reporters are vetted for a news conference and escorted 
  in two-by-two to their seats (as they were on March 6th), so as not to offend 
  the king. We also learned that Mad King George wouldn't appear before the common 
  leaders of the European Union unless he was assured of a standing ovation.</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;I hug the mothers and the widows of those who may have lost their 
  life in the name of peace and freedom,&quot; Bush has said on more than one 
  occasion. He views himself as the benevolent sovereign, sending America's finest 
  off to fight in a war for oil and hegemony, then being the &quot;First Hugger&quot; 
  for bereaved survivors. He hugs them on behalf of his personal Bush Lord, the 
  same one that sends their children off to die.</b></p>

<p><b>As for the men and women of the clergy -- representing the religious leadership 
  of every major denomination in the United States, with the exception of the 
  Southern Baptists and Evangelicals -- who believe Bush's little war is a violation 
  of God, Bush won't even meet with them. Why should King George waste his time 
  talking with these men and women of the cloth? After all, George is busy running 
  his kingdom and has a war to start. In any case, King George knows that they 
  are all impostors. God has selected only King George to implement God's divine 
  will on earth. George knows that all of these religious leaders are just hearing 
  voices, so what's the point of wasting time indulging their fantasies? </b></p>

  <b>The more I look at the chaotic mess George W. Bush is making in every blessed 
  corner of the world, THE MORE I AM INCLINED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE GOD 
  IN WHOSE NAME HE CLAIMS TO BE MAKING IT. JUST WHO IS THIS GOD THAT CHATS UP 
  BRAZEN HYPOCRITES AND ZEALOTS IN OUR MIDST -- whipping them into a frenzy of 
  pharisaic attempts to strangle democracy at home and abroad? THIS AWESOME CREATURE 
  IS ON A MURDEROUS RAMPAGE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICA -- as Donald 
  Rumsfeld would say -- EAST. WEST, NORTH AND SOUTH...Armed and jackbooted, Bush's 
  flinty-hearted Diety bears no resemblance to the compassionate and forgiving 
  God in whom Christians have put their faith for more than two millenia. </b></p>
<p><b>More and more innocents are being herded onto the world's killing fields 
  by the deliberate actions of a Christian nation -- in the name of its Christian 
  God. What blasphemy! IF CHRISTIANS ARE UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
  GOOD AND EVIL; if they cannot see that those we crush under our heel are also 
  God's creation -- then all those hours spent in Sunday School, church services, 
  summer camp and &quot;all day singing and dinner on the grounds&quot; picnics 
  were a sorry waste of time. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Sad 
  but true)</font><b>. The nature of a man is revealed by the company he keeps. 
  Those who preach that maiming and killing terrified men, women and children 
  is &quot;God's will&quot; -- who cover up the slaughter of their own citizens 
  and who topple other regimes by force or farce -- are evil men who cavort with 
  evil gods. And every single Christian in this country knows it. <br>
  </b> </p>
<p><b>THE BEAST MAY NOT YET BE LOOSED UPON THE WORLD </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(if 
  not, then what, or who are we talking about here?)</font><b>, but his minions 
  are having one hell of a good time, and laughing their asses off in the process. 
  By joining forces in a destructive &quot;means justifies the ends&quot; crusade 
  to both control and convert the world, the Neoconservatives and Religious Right 
  have created a playground for wicked gods. Each needs the other to achieve its 
  goals. And the glue that holds them together is a man whose own words indict 
  him as the proverbial village idiot who has no clue about either means or ends, 
  but who serves at this point in history as both the enabled and the enabler. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>The Neocons...I have written so much about this ungodly bunch I sometimes 
  feel like a rabid Sam Kinison, standing in the breach, screaming into the wind. 
  </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(God, I suspect, thoroughly enjoyed 
  that scene).</font><b> Except for God's coat-tails they intend to ride in on, 
  the Almighty does not enter into their equation for world domination. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Oh 
  but he does...Romans 9:17)</font><b>. Their names are familiar -- Dick Cheney, 
  Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, William Kristol, Michael Ledeen...THEY 
  TOWER CONTEMPTUOUSLY ABOVE GOD </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Isaiah 
  14...KJV)</font><b>, THEIR PLAN FOR A NEW WORLD ORDER FAR GRANDER THAN HIS, 
  and their fingerprints are all over the tens of thousands of innocents who have 
  been killed, injured or horribly maimed. They are everywhere -- from the Project 
  for a New American Century (PNAC) and other right-wing think tanks such as the 
  American Enterprise Institute (AEI) -- to the Pentagon, State Department and 
  White House. And, in their own words, they have only just begun.</b> </p>
<p><b>Ledeen is possibly the most dangerous and influential neocon of all the 
  Iran-Contra madmen who are back in power. In his book, Machiavelli on Modern 
  Leadership, Ledeen says, &quot;Creative destruction is our middle name. We do 
  it automatically...It is time once again to export the democratic revolution.&quot; 
  &quot;God,&quot; Ledeen explains, &quot;understands that all men are evil, and 
  the only way to achieve peace is through total war.&quot; Ledeen believes &quot;the 
  sparing of civilian lives cannot be the total war's first priority...The purpose 
  of total war is to permanently force your will onto another people.&quot; </b><b>In 
  the unlikely event that Americans emerge from their stupor before Ledeen and 
  his New World Order is upon them, I hope they realize that following the hostile 
  and unfamiliar God for whom Ledeen speaks would be kind of like walking a mad 
  dog on a leash... <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>The God People The Religious Right is also obsessed with power and control, 
  and the majority of its members are living proof that, like the ancient Euripides 
  wrote -- &quot;Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.&quot; God 
  walks with them; talks to them and issues militant edicts to us through them. 
  Most are Republicans -- proud &quot;born again&quot; Christians who speak deleriously 
  of &quot;God's will and the blood of Jesus Christ&quot; -- but their true religion 
  is cold, hard politics. They walk the halls of Congress, and are by far the 
  most powerful voting bloc in America. When they speak, presidents listen -- 
  constitutional amendments are proposed, freedoms are lost, liberties dry up...</b></p>
<p><b> According to a project by TheocracyWatch.org, &quot; The Rise of the Religious 
  Right in the Republican Party,&quot; they propose bills that are &quot;anti-women, 
  anti-labor and anti-civil rights. Their legislation opposes finance campaign 
  reform; environmental protection; gun control; social justice for the poor; 
  public education; teaching evolution; human sexuality; and a separation of church 
  and state.&quot; The report says their bills &quot;show a disregard for the 
  U.S. Constitution, and finally, Democracy itself. Bills coming from the Religious 
  Right favor the wealthy and large corporations. The ultimate political goal 
  is to make this country a Christian nation.&quot; (Emphasis added) </b></p>
<p><b>We smile and shake our heads at the outlandish claims of TV evangelists 
  Pat Robertson, to whom God confided recently that &quot;Bush will win the 2004 
  election in a blowout,&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(consider 
  Deuteronomy 13)</font><b>, or Jerry Falwell, who believes the &quot;idea that 
  religion and politics don't mix was invented by the Devil to keep Christians 
  from running their own country.&quot; We even giggled when Attorney General 
  John Ashcroft assured graduates at Bob Jones University that &quot;America has 
  no king but Jesus.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Trust me -- these people are not funny. For example, Tom Delay, Texas Republican 
  and House Majority Leader, once told a group of evangelical Christians that 
  God was &quot;using him&quot; to promote a biblical worldview. &quot;Only Christianity 
  offers a comprehensive worldview that covers all areas of life and thought -- 
  every aspect of creation,&quot; DeLay said. &quot;Only Christianity offers a 
  way to live in response to the realities that we find in this world. Only Christianity.&quot; 
  (Emphasis added) Like his counterparts, DeLay believes that fundamentalists 
  should &quot;overturn the separation of church and state and bring government 
  under religious control.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>And listen to Gary Potter, president of Catholics for Christian Political 
  Action -- &quot;When the Christian majority takes over this country, there will 
  be no satanic churches, no more free distribution of pornography, no more talk 
  of rights for homosexuals. After the Christian majority takes control, pluralism 
  will be seen as immoral and evil and the state will not permit anybody the right 
  to practice evil.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>But few are more frightening than Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe who strode 
  to the Senate chamber shortly after 9-11 to announce that the attacks were punishment 
  by God because we were not sufficiently in awe of Israel. Inhofe said God told 
  him Israel is &quot;entitled&quot; to the West Bank, and the U.S. should not 
  pressure Ariel Sharon to stop killing Palestinians. According to Inhofe, God 
  angrily slung three airliners full of unsuspecting souls into the World Trade 
  Center and the Pentagon, incinerating more than 3,000 innocent citizens, and 
  furiously rammed another plane into the Pennsylvania countryside -- because 
  America was not sufficiently subservient to Israel. Inhofe believes America 
  got what it deserved, and we should heed God's &quot;wake up call&quot; lest 
  He strike us again... Brother James Inhofe -- just one reason we sleep with 
  the lights on in Oklahoma...</b></p>
<p> <b>The Chosen One : From Jesus is my philosopher to God is my co-pilot, George 
  Bush has been nothing if not ghoulishly entertaining. Far more talented writers 
  than I have gone completely berserk while attempting to explain what makes Bush 
  tick. It's simple, really. The answer is Nothing. Nothing makes him tick. That's 
  why he's the perfect foil for the warhawks and religious zealots. Bush is a 
  swaggering, paranoid, hubristic bully, consumed by an irrational sense of his 
  own worth. Just your normal, run-of-the-mill Texas good ol' boy Republican -- 
  with money. After carousing, falling down drunk, and failing at every business 
  enterprise his daddy set up for him -- at the tender age of 40, Bush was &quot;born 
  again&quot; and became the Lord's own most visible high-stepping 12-stepper. 
  Fourteen years later, he was President of the United States. In his defense, 
  I have to say Bush is acting no differently than any other 14-year-old spoiled 
  bully would be expected to act under the same circumstances... </b></p>
<p><b>And he's a Believer. Bush believes what they tell him he believes, such 
  as he was chosen by God to lead the Christians in a righteous war against Islam. 
  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia even blames God for his own deadly vote 
  that thwarted democracy in 2000 and seized power from the people. Believing 
  that Bush is serving by divine appointment, Scalia wrote in a May 2002 article, 
  God's Justice and Ours that the government has a higher authority granted to 
  it by God. He said unequivocally, &quot;GOVERNMENT CARRIES THE SWORD AS MINISTERS 
  OF GOD, TO EXECUTE WRATH UPON THE EVILDOER...&quot;</b></p>

  </b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Romans 13:1-5; 2 Thessalonians 1:4-10...(KJV).<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Much of Scalia's, and therefore Bush's, belief is based on, and his core 
  speeches drawn from THE 13TH CHAPTER OF ROMANS, which admonishes citizens to 
  &quot;obey the government, for God is the one who has put it there.&quot; Punishment 
  is swift and sure for those who refuse to &quot;obey&quot; the laws of the land, 
  for the scripture says, &quot;the policeman is sent by God to help you. But 
  if you are doing something wrong, of course you should be afraid, for he will 
  have you punished. He is sent by God for that very purpose...&quot;</b></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">For there is no Power but of God: the powers that be are 
    ordained of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 13:1).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Bush shrugs aside wimps like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John who can't seem 
  to get beyond love, kindness, helping the vulnerable, caring for the needy and 
  the sheer compassion expounded by Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount, and seem 
  to prattle on endlessly about salvation. Bush is also wont to deep-six most 
  &quot;Thou Shalt Nots,&quot; because, in Romans 13, it clearly says all ten 
  commandments &quot;are wrapped up in this one -- to love your neighbor as you 
  love yourself...&quot; It is the only law Christians need to obey -- other than, 
  of course, those of the government and its Ashcroftian Mr. Policeman whom God 
  has sent to punish them... </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><a href="GiveUntoCaesar.htm">Give Unto Caesar?</a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="GiveUntoCaesar.htm"></a><b>Americans who look at Bush and see either 
  compassion or morality are severely suffering from optical delusion. This is 
  a man who sets himself up as a purveyor of truth and knowledge, but who sees 
  &quot;thugs and killers, brutal dictators and barbarians&quot; behind every 
  tree, and is committed to not let &quot;terriers and rogue nations hold this 
  nation hostile.&quot; This is a man who declared war upon Islam --calling it 
  a &quot;crusade&quot; -- from the pulpit of the National Cathedral rather than 
  the Oval Office. This is a man who enjoys what he is doing in God's name, and 
  who promises that he will not stop killing until the entire world is &quot;safe.&quot;</b></p>
