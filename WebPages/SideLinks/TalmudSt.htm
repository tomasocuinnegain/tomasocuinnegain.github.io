  Wits in Jerusalem: Talmud and St. Paul</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">BY THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, 
    Special to the New York Times.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">JERUSALEM, Jan.26...From 
    a distance the scene looks like any medieval yeshiva: young boys huddled in 
    small groups, their yarmulkas slightly askew, gesticulating wildly over thick 
    Babylonian Talmuds that lie before them.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But a closer look 
    reveals a priest's collar among the yarmulkas. Elbow-to-elbow with the yeshiva 
    boys pounding tables for emphasis is a nun. Nestled amid the Talmuds is the 
    Gospel According to John.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What lies behind 
    this ecumenical collage is an unusual experiment in Jewish-Christian understanding. 
    It is an attempt by Jewish and Christian theologians to get at the roots of 
    Christian anti-Semitism, as well as to open up Jewish thinking to the validity 
    of other religious cultures. To do this they are studying together the scriptures 
    of each religion and trying to re-examine the foundations of each faith's 
    understanding of the other.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The month-long seminar 
    is being sponsored by the New York-based National Conference of Christians 
    and Jews in conjunction with the Shalom Hartman Institute for Advanced Jewish 
    Studies, a research and learning center here.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">GRASPING 
    THE NETTLES</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The purpose of the 
    seminar--which has brought together 26 American and European Christian Bible 
    Scholars, led by Paul M. Van Buren of Temple University, and young Talmudists 
    from the Hartman Institute--is that much of the Jewish-Christian discussion 
    of the past has really avoided the gut issues dividing the two religious communities.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Previous Jewish-Christian 
    encounters, participants in the seminar say, have traditionally been either 
    debates between theologians, mutual scolding sessions or syrupy social get-togethers 
    in which both sides affirm the principle of live-and-let-live and everyone 
    goes home &quot;friends.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Every encounter 
    that took place before was either to prove who was right, who had the real 
    Truth, or was a get-together over tea on a 'some of my best friends are...' 
    basis,&quot; said Ellen Charry, associate program director of the National 
    Conference of Christians and Jews.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;That is not 
    what we are doing here. We are trying to bring each side to the edge of a 
    sympathetic understanding of the other. The old dialogue put the texts aside. 
    We want to put on the table the reality of those texts that create obstacles 
    to good fellowship and ask, 'What can we do with these documents?'&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What makes the current 
    encounter so powerful, and at times explosive, is that people's real identities 
    as Christians and Jews are at stake, Professor Van Buren said.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;People are 
    having their own understanding of their tradition challenged, and that is 
    a very powerful business,&quot; he added. &quot;We are getting into each other's 
    workshops.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The conference is 
    organized in small study groups, each containing five to six Christian theologians 
    and one Talmudist. Each group studies Talmud and reads texts from three different 
    periods: the early Rabbinic period (such as Philo and the literature of the 
    Qumran community), New Testament literature, and finally the Patristic literature 
    (the early Catholic Church interpretations of the New testament).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each group reads 
    the individual texts and tries to see how the different generations interpreted 
    the earlier sacred literature, what strategies and range of imagination they 
    used. The groups regularly prepare reports on the their findings to the whole 
    seminar, setting off wide-ranging discussions.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NO 
    ILLUSIONS</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">None 
    of the participants seem to have any illusions that they will come up with 
    clear-cut answers to the fundamental questions they are asking each other, 
    namely: Is it possible to be a believing Christian or Jew without seeing the 
    other as illegitimate to a certain extent? </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If the texts are 
    reviewed in light of the situation of today, will the roots for a new kind 
    of pluralism be there or must they always lead to &quot;I have the only truth?&quot; 
    What to do with problem texts--that is, texts that point up real divisions 
    between Christians and Jews? Can they be reinterpreted in the context of today? 
    Can they be isolated, or is there no escaping them?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For example, one 
    of the groups was reading the epistle of Paul to the Galatians, in which Paul 
    speaks about the promise God gave to Abraham and the Covenant He made with 
    the Jewish people. &quot;We ask ourselves how can Paul say that the law is 
    fulfilled in Christ,&quot; said the Rev. George C. Papademetriou, a Greek 
    Orthodox theologian from Hellenic College near Boston. &quot;What happened 
    with the Covenant God made with Abraham and Israel? Is this carried on? Some 
    say that Paul was not trying to abrogate the Covenant. Others say that he 
    was and that we might as well admit that and deal with the text differently.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">AN EXERCISE IN 
    RESPECT</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Theological 
    questions aside, just the pure encounter of learned Jewish and Christian scholars 
    interpreting texts together has been an exercise in mutual respect.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Yesterday I 
    was trying to spell out a distinction in the Talmudic passage we were working 
    on, and I got it right,&quot; said Ellen Lewin, an Episcopalian doctoral student 
    in Old Testament studies at Yale. &quot;My teacher, one of the men from the 
    Hartman Institute, looked at me quite hard and somewhat surprised and said: 
    'You know, you would make quite a good Talmudist.' I always had a feeling 
    I would be good at it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;It is the first 
    time that I have ever learned with a religious person from the Christian religion,&quot; 
    said Uri Ehrlich, a 28 year-old Talmudist. &quot;I have met some Christians 
    here and there, but never one who was as religious as me. The whole experience 
    is such a contrast to what I had in my mind of Jews cursing the Christians 
    in their texts and the Christians persecuting the Jews. Also, now we as Jews 
    can also argue with Christians in a situation in which we have the political 
    power. It makes a difference.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Indeed, it is no 
    accident that such an experiment in rethinking between Christians and Jews 
    would happen for the first time in Jerusalem, said the Jewish philosopher 
    David Hartman, founder of the institute and the man whose personal discussions 
    with Professor Van Buren provided the original spark for the seminar.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;In Jerusalem, 
    Christians can't deal with Jews as just an Old Testament people,&quot; noted 
    Mr. Hartman. &quot;They have to face the living reality here, the fact that 
    they are a living people, not just an instrument in the development of Christianity, 
    not just a wandering nation. And for the Jews, this is the best place to start 
    rethinking some of their negative attitudes about Christianity--in their own 
    country where they don't have to feel insecure.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">None of the participants 
    seem quite sure of what exactly will constitute a success for the seminar. 
    Most, it seems, will be pleased if they can at least clarify the problems 
    and agree that it is not a futile exercise to try to build a framework for 
    a new kind of tolerance--a tolerance that just wont mean not beating up on 
    each other but also being able to celebrate each other's differences.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;In the old 
    method of Jewish-Christian dialogue,&quot; said Rabbi Tzvi Marx, the education 
    director of the Hartman Institute, &quot;one side always won and one side 
    always lost. In our method everyone goes home confused.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="+2">Christian Fulfillment and Jewish-Christian Dialogue 
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">Isaac C. Rottenberg</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>LIVELY DEBATES are taking place among Christian theologians in dialogue with 
    Jews. Christians are seeking to discover what aspects of their faith are or 
    are not negotiable as churches reassess their position vis-&agrave;-vis Jews 
    and Judaism.</p>
  <p>Quite understandably, the Christian belief in Christ as the world's redeemer 
    is at the center of Christian-Jewish dialogue. Or to put the issue more in 
    terms of the Jewish dialogue partner: If redemption has occurred in Christ, 
    why is the world so obviously unredeemed? This question has profound implications 
    for other issues such as attitudes toward mission and even approaches to social-political 
    matters.</p>
  <p>Eugene Fisher's article &quot;Covenant Theology and Jewish-Christian Dialogue&quot; 
    in the January-May 1998 issue of the <i>American Journal of Theology and Philosophy 
    </i>may be taken as representative of the Christian attempt to establish common 
    ground for Christian-Jewish dialogue. He writes: &quot;While earlier generations 
    of Christian thinkers tended to stress only the 'already here' aspects of 
    New testament kerygma, more recent scholarship has sought to reintegrate the 
    eschatological 'not yet' into their vision. In other words, we ought not to 
    make claims for redemption today as if the kingdom of God had already arrived, 
    and we should not spiritualize redemption in such a way that we remove it 
    from history. Fisher reminds us that the promises of the messianic age have 
    not been fulfilled. Whatever Christians may believe about Jesus as messiah, 
    both Jews and Christians are still waiting for the fulfillment of redemption.</p>
  <p><font size="+1"></font>By emphasizing the proleptic or anticipatory nature 
    of Christ's redemptive work, and by saying that Jesus is messiah in a not 
    fully accomplished way, we can retrieve for systematic theology the &quot;not 
    yet&quot; aspect of messianic ministry and also meet some of the Jewish objections 
    to certain historic Christian claims...We may add a quote from John T. Pawlikowski: 
    &quot;All talk of a realized eschatology must be buried once and for all. 
    What we Christians in our faith now profess is that through the coming of 
    Christ we have a clearer vision of the final dimension of the kingdom.&quot;</p>
  <p>Fisher also contends that the term fulfillment should be &quot;reserved for 
    its proper eschatological usage, that is to the End Time when the Kingdom 
    will be made manifest and the One God, the God of Israel, will be all in all.&quot;...</p>
  <p>The idea of fulfillment is used both in a christological and pneumatological 
    context in that what God is doing through the Spirit is considered so dramatic 
    and so monumental that the New testament writers constantly take recourse 
    to the language of &quot;pleroma.&quot; The concept refers to time, Torah, 
    prophecy, individuals, the church, even the cosmos.</p>
  <p>For example, the stories in Acts 1-2 describe the ascension and the outpouring 
    of the Holy Spirit on all flesh, and Ephesians 4:9 explains that Christ &quot;ascended 
    far above all heavens that he might fill all things.&quot; The New testament 
    tells us that the incarnation has come to an end, but the presence of the 
    historically acting God has not.</p>
  <p>We cannot get away from the fact that in the New testament we are confronted 
    with statements about redemptive &quot;fait accomplis&quot; that are both 
    numerous and extraordinary. In Christ &quot;all the fulness (pleroma) of God 
    was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to Himself all things, 
    whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.&quot; 
    (Colossians 1:19). Something has happened. The historically acting God has 
    intervened mightily in the affairs of humankind. At the same time, we are 
    constantly reminded that as those who have tasted &quot;the powers of the 
    age to come&quot; (Hebrews 6:5), we are...(still awaiting) &quot;a salvation 
    ready to be revealed in the last time.&quot; (1 Peter 1:5)...</p>
  <p>To talk about the End Time as messianic time seems unnecessarily confusing...and 
    counter to 1 Corinthians 15:24-28. It suggests that in the end the Son will 
    deliver the kingdom of the Father...During the interim between the ascension 
    and the perousia, says the text, Christ must reign, and he does so during 
    an era when the forces of sin and death are still very much operative in the 
    world...</p>
  <p>Just as theologians have said that the revealed God remains the hidden God, 
    so we can say that the power of the age to come in our midst means that signs 
    of the kingdom, very real signs, are revealed to us while at the same time 
    the kingdom remains hidden and is yet to be revealed in all its glory. In 
    that sense the world remains unredeemed. The New Testament makes it very clear 
    that there are still hostile forces to overcome. &quot;And the last enemy 
    to be destroyed is death.&quot; (1 Cor.15:26).</p>
  <p>The New Testament message gives many reasons for joy, but none for Christian 
    triumphalism. The kingdom of God has not arrived, nor have we Christians arrived. 
    However, we are not left empty-handed either. As we read in 1 Corinthians 
    4:20, &quot;The kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.&quot; 
    Romans 14:17 expands on this theme by stating that &quot;the Kingdom of God...(means) 
    righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&quot;...</p>
  <p>Judaism also lives by a magnificent vision of the future of the Lord. Both 
    faiths represent a journey of hope. Where we clearly differ is in our understanding 
    of the meaning of redemption in light of Jesus' life and ministry... What 
    does this mean for dialogue. To answer that in a personal way, I accept the 
    fact that my Jewish friends don't believe a word of some of the things I have 
    affirmed...On the other hand I realize that mature dialogue requires one to 
    stand some heat, to recognize the profound faith perspectives that may lie 
    behind other people's rejection of one's position. This encounter can lead, 
    in turn, to a deepened respect for the faith and practices that enrich the 
    dialogue partner's life. It is to understand the pain of our dialogue partners, 
    and to face more honestly some of the terrible things that have been done 
    in the name of our own tradition.</p>
  <p>I do not believe that the kind of fulfillment theology I have briefly outlined 
    will &quot;ipso facto&quot; lead to Christian triumphalism. Whatever New testament 
    &quot;plerophoric&quot; language may mean, it most certainly does not refer 
    to a fulness in our (present) theological wisdom.&quot; <font size="2">The

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE AUTHORS OF THE 
  GOSPELS</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mention of the Essene hopes 
    of a New Age of glory leads us naturally to some comments on the special theological 
    views of the Essenes that informed their understanding of history and gave 
    to their community its peculiar institutions. The Essenes belong in the center 
    of that movement (known as) apocalypticism. The late visionaries of the Old 
    Testament, notably the author of Daniel, as well as the later Baptist and 
    Christian communities, discovered themselves to be living in the last days 
    of the Old Age, or rather in the days when the Old Age was passing away and 
    the Kingdom of God was dawning. According to apocalypticism, the upsurge of 
    evil powers in the world reflected the last defiant outbreak of cosmic Satanic 
    powers. The gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest in the community of the faithful, 
    adumbrated the age of the Spirit to follow the final war in which the Spirit 
    of Truth and his heavenly armies would put an end to the rule of the powers 
    of Darkness. The constitution of the Essene community was a crystallized apocalyptic 
    vision. Each institution and practise of the community was a preparation for 
    or, by anticipation, a realization of, life in the New Age of God's rule. 
    ON THE ONE HAND, THEIR COMMUNAL LIFE WAS A REENACTMENT OF THE EVENTS OF THE 
    END TIMES, both the final days of the Old Age AND the era of Armegeddon. </font>(An 
    understanding that is wholly, yet cryptically reflected in the Gospel narratives)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    On the other hand, their community, being heirs of the kingdom, participated 
    already in the gifts and glories that were the first fruits of the Age to 
    come. For the apocalypticists of Qumran the key to these future mysteries 
    was At Hand. One had only to read biblical prophecies with the understanding 
    given the inspired interpreter (that is, one who reads with the power of the 
    Holy Spirit) because the secrets of events to come in the last days were foretold 
    by God through the mouth of the holy prophets…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In apocalyptic exegesis, three 
    principles should be kept in mind. Prophecy openly or cryptically refers to 
    the last days. Second, the so-called last days are in fact (in types and figures) 
    the present, the days of the sect's life. And finally, the history of ancient 
    Israel's redemption, her offices and institutions, are prototypes of the events 
    and figures of the New Israel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this basis, the Essene camp 
    in the wilderness found its prototype in the Mosaic camp of Numbers (Numbers 
    2 to 4; 9:15-10:28). The Essenes retired to Qumran to 'prepare the way of 
    the Lord' in the wilderness. As God established His ancient covenant in the 
    desert, so the Essenes entered into a New Covenant on their return to the 
    desert. As Israel in the desert was mustered into army ranks in preparation 
    for the Holy War of Conquest, so the Essenes marshaled their community in 
    battle array and wrote liturgies of the Holy Warfare of Armageddon.&quot;

<p><font size="+1">Just what was Rabbi Schimeon concealing? The higher mysteries, 
  the whereabouts of the City Above, Middle Earth (Psalm 74:12-14), and the unfolding 
  of Divine Reality--the very same that are hidden in the writings of Paul, and 
  in all the subsequent gospels and various <i>Acts</i> <i>of the Apostles</i> 
  and tractates of the early Church, indeed, the very same that are unfolding 
  in the world as we speak. (And please do not confuse early Christianity with 
  the Papal and other orthodox institutions that emerged in the name of Christ 
  centuries later. Acts 20:25-35. These had no more of a sense of it than, well 
  than the rabbis did. It was hidden from everyone. Isaiah 29:10, 11; Revelation 
  5:1). Take all that we understand, and all that has been written on the subject 
  of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and all that Gershom Scholem and others have written 
  on the subject of Kabbalah. Take all of the Gnostic texts that have come down 
  to us, and all of the Pseudepigraphical literature at our disposal. (One might 
  also make good use of such works as Erwin R. Goodenough's <i>Jewish Symbols 
  in the Greco-Roman Period</i>, and G.R.S. Mead's <i>Did Jeus Live 100 B.C.? 
  An Inquiry Into the Talmud</i>)<i>. </i>Take all of these things together, and 
  lay them out from one end of the age to the other--from East to West. Lift up 
  our minds to the higher transcendent dimensions of reality, believing all things, 
  admitting every doctrinal error, and every prior inability to understand and 
  interpret the Truth of things, and we will immediately reacquire the ability 
  to interpret the whole of it in its true Light.</font></p>

  of Moses, realize that if one cannot see the Christ-spirit revealing itself, 
  not only to, but in the life of this <i>single</i> individual called Paul, while 
  hiding itself from all the sons of Darkness who came after him, they shall understand 
  nothing of the birth and meaning of Christianity. While the others in this Fellowship 
  came up into the Center of the Mystery under the name of YHShWH (the Angel of 
  Divine Presence appearing in the name of Jehoshua), the Apostle Paul (Elisha 
  ben Abuyah) is the author (or rather the reviver) of the doctrine of <i>Christ 
  and him crucified</i>. The doctrine is older than Christianity itself.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isaac M. Wise, in his &quot;Rise 
    of Christianity,&quot; says: &quot;Then we have the Talmud with its numerous 
    anecdotes about &quot;Acher,&quot; as the rabbis called Paul. These sources 
    are of inestimable value to the historian. Paul is not a proper name, it signifies 
    &quot;the little one,&quot; </font>(Amos 7:5-7; Zech.4:10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The author of Acts states that his name was Saul, but it appears he knew no 
    more about it than we do. (As Saul before David, so Paul before the Messiahs)...Passing 
    under an assumed name the rabbis called him Acher, &quot;Another, one who 
    passes under another or assumed name.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They maintain that his name was 
    Elisha Ben Abuyah, but this name must be fictitious, because it is a direct 
    and express reference to Paul's theology. It signifies &quot;the Saving Deity, 
    Son of the Father God,&quot; and Paul was the author of the Son of God doctrine. 
    The fact is he was known to the world under his assumed name only.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;The angel Metatron 
    was accorded a special position in esoteric doctrine from the tannaitic period 
    on. The angelology of apocalyptic literature mentions a group of angels wwho 
    behold the face of their king and are called 'Princes of the Countenance&quot; 
    (Ethiopic <i>Book of Enoch,</i> ch 40, et al.). Once Metatron's personality 
    takes a more definite form in the literature, he is referred to simply as 
    'the Prince of the Countenance.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the Babylonian Talmud 
    Metatron is mentioned in three places only (Hag.15a; Sanh.38b; and Av.Zar.3b). 
    The first two references are important because of their connection with the 
    polemics conducted against heretics. In <i>Haggigah</i> it is said that the 
    <i>tanna</i> Elisha b. Abuyah saw Metatron seated and said, 'perhaps there 
    are two powers,' as though indicating Metatron himself as a second deity. 
    The Talmud explains that Metatron was given permission to be seated only because 
    he was the heavenly scribe recording the good deeds of Israel. Apart from 
    this, the Talmud states, it was proved to Elisha that Metatron could not be 
    a second deity by the fact that Metatron received 60 strokes with fiery rods 
    to demonstrate that Metatron was not a god, but an angel, and could be punished. 
    This image recurs frequently in different contexts in Gnostic literature and 
    is associated with various figures of the heavenly realm. It is thought however 
    that the appearance of Metatron to Elisha b. Avuyah led him to a belief in 
    dualism.&quot; </font><font size="-1">Kabbalah, by Gershom Scholem, p.377</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">The rabbis had to reject Paul's doctrine, not 
  only because he seemed to be introducing the worship of another god (the Crucified 
  Hesus of the European Druids...Acts 17:18), rather than another manifestation 
  of the Mystery of the One God which they could not grasp in light of their own 
  religious, nationalistic and political circumstances--but on the very basis 
  of the words of the Torah themselves:</font></p>

  Christianity itself is about to come to its own conclusion, to the fulfillment

  of this age into the Light of the age-to-come. (Deuteronomy 4; Isaiah 66). And 
  those, whether they be Christian, Jew or Muslim, who insist upon a literal, 
  historic rendering of the Gospels (or the Torah, or the Qur'an), as opposed 
  to a mystical, epic and suprahistorical interpretation of these documents, shall

  of course, will, ironically, insist on a literal person (rather than <i>a mystical 
  Fellowship)</i> who came in the name of Jesus, so that they can continue to 
  concentrate, and maintain their historic animosity toward Christianity itself.

  for the animosities between them, and both are responsible, because of their 
  mutual failure to keep God's Sabbaths (the true meanings of God's holy statutes

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This article is a part 
    of a larger work entitled <i>The Gentile and the Torah--The Great Untold Story.</i> 
    This work was written to explain in detail the seven universal laws of spirituality 
    (<i>sheva mitzvot d'benei Noah</i>). Since the beginning of Christendom, conversion 
    of the Jews has always been a top priority for Christians. They have been 
    taught all their lives how Jews and Judaism are wrong and that we are &quot;blind&quot; 
    to seeing the so-called truth of their religion. For this great offense on 
    our parts, the Church teaches that Jews and especially Rabbis will burn in 
    hell for eternity. These nonsensical beliefs must come to an end </font></p>
  <p>(Of course we agree)....<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant 
    of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness 
    in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And so ALL Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There 
    shall come out of Zion the Deliverer </font></i>(and a Messiah from among 
    the Jews)<i><font size="+1">, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away 
    their sins.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, 
    but as touching the election they are beloved for the Father's sake...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 
    11:25-28).</font></p>
  <p>(And of those rabbis who lived in the time of Christ, who were appointed 
    to set a fence around the Torah, it says):<i><font size="+1"> No man also

    5:39).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For centuries holy Jewish 
    Sages have stood up against the attacks of Christian missionaries and suffered 
    the consequences for each time proving the Church wrong in disputation after 
    disputation. Today, Christian missionaries take advantage of the loss of Torah 
    identity among the majority of Jews and have succeeded in converting over 
    the last 20 years possibly more Jews than they have over the past 20 centuries. 
    Needless to say, this is quite alarming<font color="#800000">.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">Time 
    is short and I believe it is necessary to follow in the footsteps of our holy 
    Sages and go on the offense against the false teachings of Christianity. There 
    are millions of sincere G-d loving, G-d fearing Christians in the world today 
    </font><font color="#000000" size="-1">(how could this be if their religion 
    is false)?</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">

    the State of Israel. It was the trouble then, it is the trouble now)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">. 
    Indeed, in matters of morality AND POLITICS we are very similar. It is to 
    these Christians that I address these words. They ask ever so sincerely, why 
    we Jews don't see the so-called truth of their faith. Maybe this work will 
    help explain to them things that we see about Yeshu that they are blind to. 
    In no way do I wish this work to offend anybody. Unfortunately, I know that 
    it will.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">The historical 
    Yeshu was not a good person and in no way could have been a messiah. I do 
    not wish only to make a proclamation. I will endeavor to prove it. I will 
    use the Christian Bible as a source, for although we Jews do not accept its 
    accuracy or legitimacy, our Christian neighbors do accept it. May they see 
    Yeshu with our eyes and instead of trying to convert Jews to Christianity, 
    maybe they will assist us in bringing wayward Jews, who have converted back 
    to Torah and mitzvot. This is my deepest wish. I offer this work in a spirit 
    of friendship and brotherhood. May the holy light of G-d's true word, the 
    Torah, shine in the minds and hearts of us all. </font><font size="-1" color="#000000">(Amen)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What is a Messiah supposed 
    to be like? What should his characteristics be? </font><font size="-1">(Of 
    course, R. Akiba thought that Bar Kochba had all of these characteristics.

    Shouldn't he show the greatest of love, caring and forgiveness to fallen souls? 
    Is the Messiah to be a racist? An antiSemite? A blasphemer? Can the Messiah 
    possibly be a man of violence and a terrorist? </font></p>
  <p>(So let us all agree, the Messiah must not be a racist. He (or they) must 
    not favor his race over any other. And he must not oppose the doctrines of 
    Semitism, in any of their forms, whether they be Jewish, Christian or Muslim--all 
    of whom are the children of Abraham, all of whom trace their beliefs back 
    to Shem, and to the teachings that preceded Judaism, Christianity and Islam 
    together. Neither may the Messiah be a politician, or a Zionist...Opposition 
    to the State of Israel is <u>not</u> anti-Semitism). </p>
  <p><font size="-1"></font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
    to the Jewish Bible and summarized in all later Jewish holy literature, the 
    character of the Messiah is impeccable. He is to be <i>a man</i> who fulfills 
    the commandments of Torah completely. He is to restore Torah observance to 
    Israel. Let us review Yeshu's own words as to how he interacted with the Divinely 
    ordained Rabbinic authorities of his day.</font></p>
  <p> (We must, first of all, make sure that we understand the very sublime and 
    hidden relationship that Paul--Elisha ben Abuyah--had to the mystery of Christ-Metatron, 
    and in what way Paul's doctrines appeared years later in the Gospel narratives. 
    The Jewish argument with Christianity is essentially its argument with Paul, 
    a Pharisee, and with the universal, inclusive and expansive interpretation 
    that Paul placed upon the Torah. The rabbis placed a fence around the Torah 
    as they were instructed to. Paul climbed over the fence. Just as the mystery 
    of Christ is larger than Christianity, so Paul suddenly realized that the 
    Torah itself is larger than Judaism. It comprehends the entire universe):</p>

    one jot or one tittle shall no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</i></font></p>

    kingdom of heaven...</i>(Matthew<i> </i>5:17-19).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Matt. 23:2-3, Yeshu 
    is quoted as saying, </font><font size="-1"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

    do and observe</font></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Here we see that Yeshu 
    acknowledges the authority of the Sages. Remember Deut.17:9-12 states: <i>You 
    shall do according to the word that they will tell you...and you shall be 
    careful to do according to everything they will teach you. According to the 
    teaching that they will teach you and according to the judgment that they 
    will say to you, shall you do, you shall not deviate from the word that they 
    will tell you, to the right or the left. And the man that will act with willfulness, 
    not listening...to the judge, that man shall die, and you shall destroy the 
    evil from among Israel.</i></font></p>
  <p>(And while Ariel Bar Tzadok now says):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
    Yeshu, himself acknowledges that the Biblical authority rests in the hands 
    of the Rabbinic Sages, who in his days were known as the Pharisees </font>(he 
    has omitted<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>several crucial 
    considerations from the context of the precepts he has just quoted. Deuteronomy 
    17 states that if such matters are too hard to discern the supplicant shall 
    come unto <i>the priests, the Levites, and unto the judges that shall be in 
    those days...</i> The authors of the Gospels, the mystic Essenes of those 
    times, considered themselves and their Gnostic fellowship to be the true priests 
    and Levites--the true Sages of Israel. So the crux of the matter lays squarely 
    in the differences of interpretation of the Torah that existed between the 
    Essenes and Pharisees--differences that the Pharisees themselves allow, but 
    which also gave rise in time to the split between Christianity and Judaism 
    as we know them in our time. The text in Deuteronomy also states that the 
    supplicant shall get themself up <i>unto the place which the Lord thy God 
    shall choose. </i>(v.8). We know from the text at Deuteronomy 12:5, and from 
    the lamentation of Schimeon bar Jochai, that this <i>place</i> was located 
    above, in the center of the Oracle--a place which the Pharisaic rabbis of 
    those times either knew nothing about, or refused to hear anything about, 
    or had already rejected...Acts 17:6; Romans 10:1-4)...</p>

  <p>Read the entire text of Matthew, chapter 23. It is not an acquiescence to 
    Pharisaic authority. Bar Tzadok also assumes that the Pharisees of this text 
    are the same as that remnant of rabbis who were eventually set aside in those 
    times (about the time that the gospels were being written), and who eventually 
    codified the Mishna and laid the foundation for the development of the Talmud 
    centuries later. There was much confusion in those times, much being concealed, 
    and many ideas passing back and forth. (The text, however, ultimately, and 
    prophetically speaks of the ecclesiastical authorities of Christianity, who 
    are the Pharisees of our time). Nor was it in the interest of the early Church 
    to tear souls away from the Jewish faith, or away from the written Torah, 
    knowing as they did that both pillars of the Tree of life led directly into 
    our times and to the reconciliation between the two that the Most High is 
    about to accomplish. They were deeply concerned, however, for the things that 
    have finally come to pass--for the things that the rabbis rejected in Paul 
    and could not understand in the Gospels, nor in the Law and the Prophets, 
    things that have led to the establishment of the Zionist State of Israel in 
    the 20th century. Ephraim has gone backwards again--once again away from the 
    teachings of the holy Sages. (Please see Chapter 10):</p>

    to do on the Sabbath.&quot; But he said to them, &quot;have you not read what 
    David did...how he entered the house of G-d, and ate the consecrated bread, 
    which was not lawful for him to eat...or have you read in the Law that on 
    the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath, and are innocent?

    with, it is surprising to note that Yeshu's disciples were not learned enough 
    to know that the picking of grain on the Sabbath was a violation of Biblical 
    law, which under certain circumstances would lead to the death penalty. Yeshu 
    should have taught them better, but judging from his response to the Pharisees,

    bread. Therefore if it is OK for the law to be broken for David, then surely 
    it is OK for the law to be broken for Yeshu's disciples. This response of 
    Yeshu makes no sense in light of Jewish law. You see, the priests did not 
    violate the law in giving the bread to David and his men. Anyone with knowledge 
    of Hebrew can research this law and see for yourselves that what the priests 
    did was entirely allowable. Therefore, when Yeshu declared, <i>they ate the

    to the Rabbis by accepting admonishment and by correcting the ways of his 
    disciples. Yet instead of doing what Torah demands, Yeshu, again, goes on 
    the offense against G-d's holy servants. Yeshu strikes out against the <i>innocent</i> 
    Rabbis calling them hypocrites. But why? The story...does not reveal any trace

  the traditions of men rather than the higher implications of the Law itself,

    on its own accord and established itself and became manifest...If they say

  reflect the world-view of the Jewish people--but not before clearly admitting 
  that almost everything, every indictment and every resentment, and every ill-feeling 
  the Jews have against Christianity, are well-founded and true. Christianity 
  has been both a good thing and an evil thing in the earth, and this because 
  passing through <i>the Era of Wickedness</i> the sons of Darkness have made 
  up more than half of its congregation, and still do. (2 Peter 2, the Book of

    is Judaism's recognition that the Torah is indeed comprised of precepts and 
    statutes, historical allegories and epic metaphors, that do require the insights 
    of those learned in the ways of Law. By the time the Mishna is codified, toward 
    the end of the 2nd century A.D., and the Talmuds are composed over the following 
    centuries, the belief against Christianity is dogmatically sealed in the minds 
    of the Rabbis, for reasons that are very evident. Even if they wanted to include 
    something in their own ongoing commentary that came close, or supported any 
    of the doctrines of Christianity, they would be compelled to reconfigure such 
    ideas in purely non-Christic terms. Of course they were not entirely successful. 
    A reading, for instance, of <i>Everyman's Talmud, The Major Teachings of the 
    Rabbinic Sages</i>, is a basic primer for the reconciliation of the two faiths--when 
    one understands the Kabbalistic foundations of Christianity that is...</p>

      basic purpose of the Talmud was to provide the Jewish people with a body 
      of teaching which should be more than a creed, but also a guide of life 
      in every phase. It created the world in which the Jew moved and had his 
      being. From the roots of the six hundred and thirteen precepts contained

    versions which they disseminate to the gullible <i>goyim</i> for public consumption...</font></p>

    understanding of the Old Testament, they are un</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">knowingly

    of the Pharisees and the patrimony of Babylon, from whence the Talmudic and 
    Kabbalistic traditions of Judaism ultimately derive. Orthodox Judaism's other 
    sacred book, the <i>Kabbalah</i>, is filled with astrological teachings, fortune-telling, 
    gematria, necromancy and demonology...Furthermore, the Israeli &quot;Star 
    of David&quot; is actually nothing of the kind, but rather an occult hexagram 
    which became associated with the Khazars in 14th century Bohemia. (The mis-named

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(RETURNING NOW TO BAR 
    TZADOK):</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the version of this 
    episode in Matt.15:1-9, Yeshu's response to the question of hand washing is 
    answered by changing the subject. Here, Yeshu brings up the topic of vows 
    to G-d. He condemnes the law which states that devotion to G-d comes before 
    devotion to one's parents. This is a queer thing for Yeshu to say when he 
    himself has previously said, <i>He who loves father and mother more than me 
    is not worthy of me</i>. (Matt.10:37).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is true, that which 
    is devoted to G-d becomes the property of the temple. But Yeshu here insinuates 
    that adult children are intentionally dedicating their financial goods to 
    the temple just so as to deprive their elderly parents of support. From where 
    did Yeshu derive this idea? This, indeed, would be a cruel thing for anybody 
    to do. Granted, it is a lawful thing to do, but why would anyone give away 
    to the temple something that could and would stay in the family? Yeshu's argument 
    simply does not make any economic sense. In all of Jewish literature relating 
    to the topic of vows and the temple, we do not find even one instance or reference 
    to anything similar to what Yeshu is referring. And besides, what does all 
    this have to do with the washing of hands? That was the original topic. Instead 
    of dealing with the issue, Yeshu avoided it.</font></p>
  <p>(Well first of all, Yeshu's response was <i>not</i> a direct answer to the 
    question. He was instead likening his disciples' disregard for the tradition 
    of hand washing to the Pharisee's disregard for the actual commandment to 
    Honor, not merely <i>thy father and mother, </i>but <i>The</i> Father and 
    Mother--God Themselves, the oldest parents of all. And then he implied that 
    the Pharisees break this commandment by violating another on the way, one 
    that has everything to do with hand washing and foot washing, and being <i>set 
    free</i>:</p>
  <p><i>And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle 
    of the congregation, saying:</i></p>
  <p><i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, if any man of you 
    bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, 
    even of the herd, and of the flock, </i>(in other words, one must bring themself, 
    their whole self, every thought, every emotion, and every desire)<i>.</i></p>
  <p><i>If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male 
    without blemish </i>(and this word <i>male</i> opens up a whole other set 
    of meanings), <i>HE SHALL OFFER IT OF HIS OWN VOLUNTARY WILL AT THE DOOR OF 
    THE TABERNACLE OF THE CONGREGATION BEFORE THE LORD</i>...(Leviticus 1:1-3).</p>
  <p>Yeshu's temple is the whole world, and the Doorway to the Greater Tabernacle 
    is situated in the heart and mind of every child of God...</p>

    AND THE RABBIS</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One message 
    comes through loud and clear throughout the four gospels: Yeshu did not get 
    along at all with the Pharisaic Rabbinic leadership of his day. The Christian 
    will, of course, fault the Rabbis for being religious bigots and hypocrites. 
    Yet, exact details of just what hypocrisy individual Rabbis have done is never 
    mentioned. Also, since when is an entire group to be condemned for the mistakes 
    of only a few? Granted, there must have been some Rabbis who were not the 
    epitome of righteousness and holiness. We are, after all, only humans. But 
    why should Yeshu, a prospective messiah in the eyes of his disciples, seek 
    to condemn the entire Rabbinate? The Rabbinate, was created by G-d. Deut.17 
    clearly documents this</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Again, the 
    Christian will answer by referring to the hypocrisy of the Rabbis. Yet, the 
    Christian is simply repeating Yeshu's unfounded accusations. What hypocrisy 
    are we talking about? Yeshu only makes general accusations against an entire 
    group of people (ref. Matt.6:2-5, 23:4-7). We have words to describe this 
    type of behavior: sterotype prejudice. More than this, with his condemnations 
    and foul, violent language, Yeshu violates a number of Biblical commandments..</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When asked 
    (Matt.22:36-40) what is the greatest of commandments, Yeshu responds that 
    the love of G-d and the love of neighbor are the two most important. <i>On 
    these two commandments depend the whole law.</i> In light of Yeshu's stereotypical 
    prejudice against the Pharisaic Rabbis, let us review his own words as to 
    how he fulfills the commandment to <i> love your neighbor as yourself</i>. 
    (Lev.19:18; Matt.22:39). With regards to the Rabbis (Pharisees), who are his 
    neighbors, Yeshu says in Matt.23:23-33:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Woe to 
    you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. You blind guides...thay are full of 
    robbery and self indulgence. You blind Pharisees...For you are like whitewashed 
    tombs which on the outside appear beautiful but inside they are full of dead 
    men's bones and all uncleanness. (Think about the human relics in Catholic 
    altars). Even so you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly are 
    full of hy[pocrisy and lawlessness...You serpents, you brood of vipers...</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Are these 
    the words of a dissenting Jew or are they the words of a Nazi anti Semite? 
    If I didn't know any better, I would swear these words belonged to the latter. 
    Whatever happened to <i>According to the teaching that they will teach you 
    and according to the judgment that they will say to you, shall ye do, you 
    shall not deviate from the word that they will tell you, right of left</i>. 
    (Deut.17)? Whatever happened to <i>Love your neighbor as yourself</i> ?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yeshu's 
    vicious attack against the Pharisees violates both of these laws as well as 
    these other Biblical laws: <i>You shall not go up and down as a talebearer 
    among your people. You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall 
    not bear a grudge against the children of your people. </i>(Lev.19:17-18)...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yeshu is 
    clearly making a personal attack on a group of fellow Jews, in gross violation 
    of the Torah...He takes a stand very clearly against the authorities that 
    G-d Himself has ordained, and to which Yeshu, himself, has acknowledged as 
    authorities.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Those who call themselves Jews today are by and large indignant 
  at the way the term is used in the New Testament to describe those who opposed 
  and persecuted Christ. And this indignation flows from the general belief, not 
  merely that they are the only true Jews but that they have always been, and 
  therefore, that the Gospels must necessarily be referring to them. Normative 
  Judaism as we know it today springs from that sect of Jews who were set aside 
  by God out of all other groups of Jews in the time of Christ--actually, after 
  the time of Christ. They were set aside, despite their unbelief it seems, but 
  because of their zealous refusal to see the Torah spiritualized out of existence, 
  or to see it perverted as they perceived it to be by the world around them, 
  by the Greeks, the Hasmoneans, the Saddducees and the Zealots--and what of these 
  Essenes? We are already seeing how the lines of communication were opened between 
  the Essenes and these Pharisees, and how the one was secretly informing the 
  other. Realize also, that the Talmud, and therefore the &quot;Jews&quot; of 
  Christ's time, knows nothing of the events being described in the Gospels. &quot;When 
  did we do this?&quot; &quot;How did it happen?&quot; &quot;Where did it happen.&quot; 
  &quot;Who is this Yeshu?&quot; Finding itself accused a hundred years or more 
  later, as the Christian story of initiation began to circulate, of things it 
  knew nothing of, Judaism had to reach back into its own archives and come up 
  with the Jeschu stories to make sense of it, or to rationalize it to themselves 
  and (at their own peril at times) to others. What we have in the Christian narratives, 
  however, is a classic case of &quot;If the Shoes fits wear it.&quot; For just 
  as the Gospels imply a Universal Israel, and a Cosmic Christ (who is killed 
  every day by Jews, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, agnostics, humanists, 
  and all others who partake in the rituals of human warfare and execution), so 
  are they also referring to the Universal Jew, of which the whole world was filled 
  in those times...Jews in Egypt and Africa, Jews in the East, Jews in Europe, 
  in Rome, in Athens, in Britain, in India, in America, Jews everywhere. They 
  are referring to all who made a claim to the God of Israel (there is only ONE 
  God), or even in the least wise to the doctrines and the teachings of Israel--which 
  are comprised of the doctrines of all the other world-religions combined.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then this indignation flows from the fact that as the emerging 
  World-church (which had not grasped the hidden message of the Gospels to begin 
  with), came to power, it began to harass and then eventually persecute those 
  who still called themselves Jews (just as it did, however, to the true Christians 
  and all those others <i>heretics</i> and dissidents over the centuries that 
  it could not distinguish from each other, other than the collective fact that 
  they would not adhere to the teachings and the authority of the now powerful 
  and imperial World-church). As this World-church began to encourage its followers 
  (the mindless masses), to consider these Jews <i>Christ-killers</i> it could 
  not see--in its own lofty sense of itself--that it had become the <i>Jews</i> 
  who were persecuting and killing Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Likewise the religious world today is divided, as the world 
  was then, into three basic levels of attachment to the affairs of the world 
  itself. We understand it in the words: <i>Take heed and beware of the leaven 
  of the Pharisees and Sadducees </i>(Matthew 16:6-12), and in our understanding 
  now of the existence of that third class in Israel, the Essenes. This latter 
  class gave us, or rather helped preserve for us, the Qumran library which assists 
  us in all of our present conclusions. Certain members of this class, among whom 
  John the Baptist appeared in those times, also gave us the Gospels which, along 
  with the works of Josephus, help us in our definition of the differences that 
  existed between these three classes:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Sadducees are the worldly and the &quot;purely ethical.&quot; They are 
    the temple elite. They are aligned with and friendly with the powers of the 
    age. They associate their fate, here in the West, with the fate of Politic-America. 
    They believe in no culminating events in history, no Messiah, no Resurrection, 
    and stay busy elevating the souls of men into the status-quo. They are religious, 
    unspiritual, and generally affluent, exploiting not only the religious sentiments 
    of the other echelons of society, but along with them the great bounty that 
    God has provided for the benefit of all. The Sadducees of old were scattered 
    (into other forms of Jewishness), or perished, when God sent the Romans down 
    to destroy that city and that temple made with hands. (Please be mindful that 
    Moscow is called the Third Rome). In terms of the Mystical Body they are the 
    &quot;flesh,&quot; or that which is enslaved to serve the spirit. They are 
    in bondage and cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
  <p>The Pharisees: these live in two worlds. They know there is a mystery, an 
    oral tradition, a world above and a world below. They war in the spirit against 
    the world below, but when expedient they will forsake the higher world for 
    the lower. They will, if it serves their interests, kill for things &quot;below,&quot; 
    even sacrificing their sons and daughters to the &quot;Consuming Fire.&quot; 
    (Deuteronomy 4:1-39; Hebrews 12:12-29). This because they fight two wars, 
    and carry two swords. They know there is a mystery, but they do not know it; 
    an oral tradition, but they do not know its precepts. Yet they know in part. 
    They are above and below. They know there is a resurrection, and they study 
    and prepare for it, but they stumble over its meanings. They cling to the 
    &quot;letter&quot; and oppose the Spirit. They are divided in affection between 
    the Sadducees and the Essenes.</p>
  <p>The Essenes (and by this we mean those who gave themselves over to the teachings 
    of John the Baptist, and eventually Paul) are the remnant in every generation. 
    They go by many names and no names at all. They live closest to God, and the 
    Holy Spirit is at home in their hearts. They are free from the trammels of 
    their age because they bind themselves to the inner meanings of God's laws. 
    They do not kill, nor do they search the scriptures for permission to do so, 
    knowing how these interpretations are reserved for the children of Darkness. 
    They are found among the other two classes, but mostly they are found where 
    their sentiments reside--laboring in various ways for and among the poor, 
    the oppressed, and the infirm. They are found in communities of like-minded 
    individuals, or in no communities at all. Some are still found living alone 
    in contemplation, overcoming not only the collective transgressions of their 
    age but the private transgressions of their own hearts. They live by the Eightfold 
    Precepts and by the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

    and that nothing befalls men unless it be in accordance with her decree. But 
    the Sadducees do away with fate, holding that there is no such thing and that 
    human actions are not achieved in accordance with her decree, but that all 
    things lie within our own power, so that we ourselves are responsible for

  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Chronologically 
    speaking, it is in apocalyptic literature that we find the first appearance 
    of ideas of a specifically mystical character, reserved for the elect. Scholars 
    do not agree on whether the origins of this literature are to be found among 
    the Pharisees and their disciples or among the Essenes...It is known from 
    Josephus that the Essenes possessed literature which was both magical and 
    angeloligical in content. His silence concerning their apocalyptic ideas can 
    be understood as his desire to conceal this aspect of contemporary Judaism 
    from his gentile readers. The discovery of the literary remains of the Qumran 
    sect shows that such ideas found a haven among them. They possessed the original 
    Book of Enoch...In fact traditions resembling those embedded in the Book of 
    Enoch found their way into rabbinic Judaism at the time of the <i>tannaim</i> 
    and <i>amoraim</i> (from the first century to the sixth), and it is impossible 
    to determine the breeding ground of this type of tradition until the problems 
    presented by the discovery of the Qumran writings have been solved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Book of Enoch was 
    followed by apocalyptic writings up to the time of the <i>tannaim</i>, and 
    in different ways even later. Esoteric knowledge in these books touched not 
    only upon the revelation of the end of time and its awesome terrors, but also 
    upon the structure of the hidden world and its inhabitants: heaven, the Garden 
    of Eden, and Gehinnom, angels and evil spirits, and the fate of the soul in 
    the hidden world. Above this are revelations concerning the Throne of Glory 
    and its Occupant, which should apparently be identified with &quot;the wonderful 
    secrets of God&quot; mentioned by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Here a link can be 
    established between this literature and the much later traditions concerning 
    the doctrines of Creation and the Chariot...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The mysteries of the 
    Throne constitute here a particularly exalted subject which to a large extent 
    set the pattern for the early forms of Jewish mysticism...The mysteries of 
    the world of the Throne (derived from the first chapter of Ezekiel, the Book 
    of the Son of Man), together with those of the Divine Glory which is revealed 
    there, are the parallels in Jewish esoteric tradition to the revelations on 
    the realm of the divine in Gnosticism...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Evidence concerning the 
    involvement of Johannan ben Zakkai and his disciples in this sort of exposition 
    proves that this esotericism could grow in the very center of a developing 
    rabbinic Judaism, and that consequently this Judaism had a particular esoteric 
    aspect from its beginning. On the other hand, it is possible that the rise

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">YESHU AND THE GENTILES</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Bar Tzadok continues). 
    It is quite clear that Yeshu did not approve of the Rabbinic authorities of 
    his day. Yet the Christian Bible makes it just as clear that there was another 
    group of people that Yeshu disliked even more than the Rabbis. Matt.12:18 
    states that Yeshu fulfills the &quot;prophecy&quot; of Isaiah which says, 
    <i>he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles...and in his name the Gentiles 
    will hope. </i>It is clear that the Christian Bible tries to present Yeshu 
    as the salvation of the Gentiles. Yet, it appears that Yeshu, himself, had 
    his own ideas regarding Gentiles<i>. </i>Matt.15:22-27 records the following 
    episode:</font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And behold, a Canaanite 
    woman came out from that region, and began to cry out, saying, Have mercy 
    on me...but he did not answer her a word...she came and began to bow down 
    before him saying, lord help me. And he answered and said, It is not good 
    to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Do you get it? This poor 
    needy woman came to a man she believed would help her and he called her a 
    dog! Personally I have always been very disturbed by this comment of Yeshu. 
    I has always wondered how the Christian clergy could ever justify such disgusting 
    racism. What I found out disgusted me even more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I consulted the &quot;New 
    Bible Commentary&quot;...which I was told by many fundamentalist Christians 
    is an authoritive work in their eyes. With regards to this verse, the commentary 
    (pg.925) states that Yeshu <i>was confronting her with the sort of language 
    a gentile could expect to hear from a Jew</i>. Now I understood. The reason 
    why the racism of Yeshu is not mentioned by Christian clergy is because the 
    commentators on his words are themselves racists! What an anti Semitic thing 
    to say! Calling a Gentile a dog was the kind of language that an average Jew 
    would use. What an anti Semitic racist lie!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One simply need consult 
    the numerous Rabbinic literature from this time period to see just how atrocious 
    this slanderous blood libel truly is! I certainly pray that not all Christian 
    Bible commentaries teach this way. It certainly is not the Jewish way to speak 
    so derogatorily about Gentiles. In fact such type of talk is forbidden by 
    Jewish law. But this small matter of Jewish law did not seem to upset Yeshu. 
    Nor is this one instance the only time when Yeshu and his disciples speak 
    in racist derogatory fashion about Gentiles.</font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And when you are praying, 
    do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do...</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Matt.6:7).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Is this not a derogatory 
    thing to say? Do all Gentiles use <i>meaningless repetition</i> when they 
    pray? How about you, my Gentile reader? If Yeshu wanted to condemn meaningless 
    repetition in prayer, why didn't he simply say so? Why did he have to say 
    <i>as the Gentiles do</i>? Truly these are racist words.</font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Do not be anxious 
    then, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or with what shall 
    we cloth ourselves? For all these things the Gentiles eagerly seek</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">. 
    (Matt.6:32).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yeshu is speaking about 
    faith. He wishes to encourage his listeners to have faith in G-d with regards 
    to their daily needs. That is all well and good. Yet, when referring to those 
    who have no faith, Yeshu refers specifically to the Gentiles. It is they who 
    eagerly seek these things. And no Jew seeks or worries about these things? 
    Only Gentiles have this concern? Again, this is a derogatory slap in the face 
    to all Gentiles....Why could not have Yeshu have said, <i>for all these things, 
    those lacking in faith seek</i>? No, he had to make a dig at the Gentiles, 
    in direct violation of Jewish law. Truly these are racist words.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Matt.18:17, Yeshu 
    states that those who do not accept his message should be treated like a Gentile. 
    His intent is that the person would be outcast. But this is Yeshu's personal 
    understanding of how to treat Gentiles. It most certainly does not agree with 
    Jewish law or practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It appears that Yeshu's 
    disciples had well learned this lesson of racism from him. His top disciple 
    Peter shares his teacher's racist views. In 1 Peter 4:3, he is recorded to 
    have said, </font><font size="-1"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let 
    the time that is past suffice for doing what the Gentile likes to do, living 
    in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry</font></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">. 
    In our many sins, there are those Jews, even in Yeshu's day, who committed 
    these sins. Why then are the Gentiles singled out for condemnantion? Truly 
    these are racist words, spoken by a racist and taught by a racist.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Seeing Yeshu's poor attitude 
    towards Gentiles, I wonder if the Gentile Christian of today realizes that 
    is he/she were alive in Yeshu's time, Yeshu would have called him a dog, or 
    wouldn't have even spoken to him at all. Again, I ask you, are these the deeds 
    of a messiah (especially the messiah of the Gentiles)?</font></p>
  <p>(We do not want to automatically rush to a defense of the Gospels here, not 
    while these charges against Yeshu seem to have some validity--at least on 
    the surface. An atonement must be made for all of those who have interpreted 
    these texts in the same light as Bar Tzadok, and who have treated the Gentiles, 
    or any who are outside of the faith, in the same religious manner that Bar 
    Tzadoc suggests--with disdain for their place in the family of God. Could 
    Yeshu be guilty of it?</p>
  <p>Did Yeshu see the Gentiles in a different light than he saw the children 
    of Israel? When he spoke to them, or of them, was it in a different voice, 
    or with a separate regard than he had for the House of Israel? A good father, 
    as well as a good shepherd, can be direct with all of those he cares for, 
    especially as he draws them to maturity, to a state of spiritual awareness 
    and self-reflection. Are there not two sides to the Tree? The side of Judgment 
    and Severity, and the side of Love and Mercy? Did not Yeshu balance the two 
    in himself? What does the Gentile hear when he or she hears Yeshu speak of 
    the Gentiles? Do they take it personally? Or do they understand what he means? 
    Do they hear him speaking of themselves, directly, uncaringly? or of who they 
    used to be? or of whom they know themselves to already be and should no longer 
    be? He is speaking to them in codes, in ways that they themselves understand 
    and accept, and has already mixed his consternation with the comforting words: 
    <i>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you 
    rest...</i>(Matthew 11:28-30). As he holds the Gentiles apart from himself 
    with one hand, he draws them to himself with the other. Salvation is, after 
    all, of the Hebrew prophets--not because of the individual prophets, however, 
    but because of the subject matter itself. </p>
  <p>As for the Canaanite woman. She comes to him with a petition. Her daughter 
    is vexed with a devil (there is no hope for the future). He does not respond, 
    but his heart and mind is immediately locked to her's. The Tantric moment 
    between them is still charged with meaning. He knows exactly how many steps 
    there are between himself and her. If she should fall back, or go away in 
    hopelessness and despair, time itself would stop, for the lesson is to every 
    generation. He draws her closer to him. Her power is irresistible. A didactic 
    moment in history is unfolding. Send her away, his disciples are made to say. 
    He answered and said: <i>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house 
    of Israel. </i>What is he saying?<i> </i>Who is he speaking to? To them? Of 
    her? Or to all of us together? <i>Lord help me</i>, she says as she humbles 
    herself before all the world. She is already in the House. He painfully allows 
    her. <i>It is not meet</i>, he says, alluding to a precept of the Torah, <i> 
    to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs</i>. He has uttered the 
    words just so that she, in turn, may say, <i>Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat 
    of the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</i> Her words penetrate 
    to the very heart and mind of the Christ experience, and fulfill the entire 
    meaning and intent of the Law itself..</p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">YESHU AND 
    VIOLENCE</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Bar Tzadok): 
    The Christian bible records Yeshu teaching <i>do not resist him who is evil...love 
    your enemies and pray for those who persecute you</i>. (Matt.5:39,44). Based 
    upon these words in Yeshu's famous Sermon on the Mount, Christianity portrays 
    Yeshu as being quite a pacifist, a man who abhorred violence. This portrayal 
    however does not match the facts of Yeshu's life that are outlined in the 
    Gospels. Unnoticed by most Christians and rationalized away by others are 
    Yeshu's proclamations and acts of violence:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Do not 
    think that I came to bring peace on earth; I did not come to bring peace, 
    but a sword</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">. 
    (Matt.10:34; Luke 12:51).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I have heard 
    Christian apologists attempt to rationalize these threatening words of violence 
    as being &quot;symbolic,&quot; meaning that Yeshu was simply speaking about 
    the disturbance his words would cause, and that they (his words) would be 
    &quot;like a sword&quot; taking away peace from those who would refuse his 
    message. This type of rationalization does not stand up as being factual in 
    light of Yeshu's own actions. Yeshu, instead of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; 
    and &quot;forgiving his enemies and praying for them,&quot; decides to attack 
    them physically in an act which can only be considered an organized act of 
    religious terrorism.</font></p>
  <p align="left">(Bar Tzadok will now go on to relate the incident in which Yeshu 
    goes into the temple, overturns the tables, and drives out the money changers. 
    And we shall return to this incident shortly. But first let us understand 
    who and what we are dealing with here when we speak of Yeshu--the subject 
    of the Christian scriptures. We are not talking about one person, or of one 
    particular time in history. The Gospels are a very sublime example of <i>Midrash</i>, 
    in which the expositors of the texts have spread out before us 2,000 years 
    of human history. The Gospels are <i>sealed </i> documents, which we may only 
    now begin to open. The things written in them did not happen as they are recorded, 
    they are <i>happening</i> as recorded, as Paul himself has written: <i>Knowing 
    therefore the TERROR of the Lord. </i>(2 Corinthians 5:11). <i>Beware of him, 
    provoke him not, for My Name is in him. </i>(Exodus 23:21). This is not childish 
    word-play, we are dealing with the terrible realities of history here, and 
    with things that have come so vividly to pass in the 20th century, and which 
    are still unfolding before our very eyes.</p>
  <p align="left"><i>I am the Lord, and beside me there is none else. There is 
    no God beside me. </i>(This is the Lord God of the Universe, the Great <i>Ain 
    Sof</i>, speaking directly through the Angel of Divine Presence). <i>I form 
    the light, and create darkness, I make peace, I create evil. I the Lord do 
    all these things...</i>(Isaiah 45:5-7).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>God has formed all things for himself, even the wicked for 
    the day of evil...</i>(Proverbs 16:4).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>I kill, I make alive, I wound, I heal, see there is no God 
    with me...</i>(Deut.32:39; Dan.12:7; Rev.10:5-7).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>Woe to them who say the Lord will do neither good nor evil...</i>(Zephaniah 
    1:12).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>The Lord is known by the judgments he executes...</i>(Psalm 
    9:16).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living 
    God...</i>(Hebrews 10:31).</p>
  <p align="left"><i>And so terrible was the sight</i> (as Moses looked into the 
    events of the 20th century)<i> that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake...</i>(Hebrews 
    12:21; Exodus 19 and 20).</p>
  <p align="left">Those who experienced the Presence of the Angel in their own 
    time, and who framed the Gospels for all times, understood the sublime import 
    of the words which said: <i>Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth 
    his secret unto his servants the prophets</i>. (Amos 3:1-8). They realized 
    the sublime and absolute implications of their relationship to the One from 
    whom both good and evil flows. He is the God of Destruction, He is the Consuming 
    Fire, and the very God of War himself. He is terrible in his Majesty and will 
    have no other gods before Him. They saw Him in the Roman legions who came 
    to level that city made of stones in Palestine. They saw Him in the Barbarian 
    hordes who in turn came against Rome. They saw Him wielding the Sword of Islam, 
    as He came up out of that barren landscape in the Seventh century. History 
    watched Him bringing judgment against every man, and every nation, who ever 
    stood in violation of the precepts of God. We see Him now turning the Sword 
    back against Islam, and then we will witness as He then turns His most terrible 
    weapons against America and those nations who have a hand in attacking Islam. 
    And in the midst of it all, the great spiritual reality is, that the Terrible 
    God of War will reveal Himself to none but children of perfect peace, as it 
    is also written: <i>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which 
    no man shall see the Lord. </i>Hebrews 12:14):</p>
  <p align="left"><i>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, 
    be diligent that ye might be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless</i>...(2 
    Peter 3:14).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They pay no heed to the real 
    hidden meaning of things, but divert themselves instead with all kinds of 
    iniquitous arcane lore. They do not know the hidden meaning of what is actually 
    taking place, nor have they ever understood the lessons of the past. Consequently, 
    they have no knowledge of what is coming upon them and have done nothing to 
    save their souls from the deeper implication of present events.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, however, will symbolize things 
    for you. What is going to happen is, as it were, that all iniquity is going 
    to be shut up in the womb and prevented from coming to birth. Wrong is going 
    to depart before Right, as darkness departs before light. As smoke disappears 
    and is no more, so will Wrong disappear for ever. But Right will be revealed 
    like the Sun. The world will rest on a sound Foundation. All who cling to 
    rarified arcane lore will cease to exist. The world will be filled with knowledge, 
    and ignorance exist no more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The thing is certain to come. The 
    prophecy is true, and by this you may know that it will not be revoked. Do 
    not all peoples hate wrongdoing? Yet is it not rampant among them all? Are 
    not the praises of truth sung by all nations? Yet is there a single race or 
    tribe that really adheres to it? What nation likes to be oppressed by a stronger 
    power? Or who wants his property plundered unjustly? Yet is there a single 
    nation that has not oppressed its neighbor? Or where in the world will you

    preach the gospel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things...</i>(Romans 
    10:12-15; Isaiah 52:7; Nahum 1:15).</p>
  <p>It is in this same prophetic context that we understand the words in Isaiah:</p>

    is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed...</i></p>
  <p><i>Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve

    of the authors of the Gospels):</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Matt.21:12-13 relates, 
    <i>And Yeshu entered into the Temple and cast out those who were buying and

    seats of those who were selling doves. And said to them, It is written, My 
    house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a robber's 
    den. </i>This story is also related in John 2:14-16. Here it is recorded that 
    it is the Passover, a time when Jews from all over the world come to Jerusalem 
    to offer the Pascal sacrifice as ordained by Biblical law. (Deut.14:22,23)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In other words, Yeshu 
    was so zealous for the honor of the temple that the mere presence of these 
    cheating moneychangers and animal salesmen was an abomination. The temple 
    is to be a house of prayer and nothing more. These are nice sentiments, but 
    again they portray Yeshu's lack of knowledge of scripture and lack of respect 
    for the temple and its authority.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Deut.14:22-23, G-g 
    had ordained the law that every male Jew should come to Jerusalem at Passover 
    time to offer &quot;the increase of your seed&quot; and &quot;the tithe of 
    your corn, wine and oil, the first of your herd and flock.&quot; In other 
    words, the temple, aside from being simply a house of prayer was a house of 
    sacrifice. This is clearly portrayed in the Bible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Deut.14:24-26 continues 
    to give the ordinance for the one who does not live near Jerusalem at sacrifice 
    time. How was he to carry all of his fruits and firstborns the long distance 
    to Jerusalem? In Yeshu' day, there were Jews visiting the temple from as far 
    away as Rome and Babylon. Torah law had forseen their long distance trip and 
    ordained, <i>And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able 
    to carry it...Then you shalt turn it into money, bind up the money in your 
    hand, and go to the place the L-rd, your G-d chooses. And spend the money 
    on whatever you desire: oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink...and you shall eat 
    there before the L-rd, your G-d and rejoice</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Here G-d has ordained 
    that money be brought to his temple and there exchanged for the necessities 
    of eating before the L-rd. Josephus, the Jewish historian, living at the time 
    of the destruction of the temple writes that on an average Passover, there 
    were 250,000 sacrifices offered. Each sacrifice was for a group of ten, therefore, 
    there must have been at least 2 1/2 million people in Jerusalem for an average 
    Passover. Being that the majority of these people were visitors, where were 
    they supposed to purchase their offerings? Being that they came into Israel 
    with foreign currency, where could they go to exchange it into local currency? 
    remember that there were no banks then.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In order to fulfill the 
    Divine commandments to exchange the monies brought from afar, the temple itself, 
    in accordance with Biblical law, not in violation of it, provided for the 
    pilgrims the means to fulfill the Bible's commandments. In other words, the 
    moneychangers and the sellers of doves were themselves fulfilling an important 
    Biblical commandant.</font></p>

  <p align="left">&quot;The Qumran Essenes separated themselves from the Jerusalem 
    Temple and its sacrificial cult. The Temple's offerings of animals were replaced 
    by the 'offerings of the lips' (that is, prayers) and by works of the law. 
    Man must render himself to the Lord as a pleasing sacrifice; he must bring 
    his spirit and body, his mental and physical capacities, together with his 
    material goods and property, into the community of God. In this community 
    all of these gifts will be cleansed of the pollution of selfish ambition through 
    humble obedience to the commandments of God. (Manual of Discipline 1:11-13).</p>
  <p align="left">The Qumran community was intended to be a living sanctuary. 
    They believed this living temple, consisting of people, rendered a better 
    service to God than the Jerusalem sanctuary made of stones. The chosen &quot;stones&quot; 
    of the community were witnesses to the truth of God and made atonement for 
    the land (Manual of Discipline 8:6-10); in this way, the community protects 
    the land and its people from the consuming wrath of God and the catastrophe 
    of His judgment. The Jerusalem Temple could not do this as long as disobedient 
    priests served in it.</p>
  <p align="left">John the Baptist, the son of a priest, also had a conflict with 
    the Jerusalem hierarchy, similar to the conflict between the Essenes and the 
    Jerusalem hierarchy. He must have shared the Essenes' belief in the superior 
    quality of the spiritual temple of God. He warned the people not to rely on 
    the fact that Abraham was their father, for 'God is able from these stones 
    (these precepts of the law) to raise up children to Abraham (That is, a truly 
    repentant community...Matthew 3:9). This famous saying contains a marvelous 
    play on words in Hebrew. 'Children' is <i>banim; </i>stones is <i>abanim</i>. 
    The saying thus presupposes the idea of a living temple 'of men.' John is 
    saying that God can create genuine <i>children</i> of Abraham 'from these 
    <i>stones</i> and build them into the sanctuary of His community.&quot; <font size="2">Understanding

    what manner of stones are here, and how beautiful is the work of our ancestors? 
    And Yeshu said, Yea, it is beautiful and well wrought are the stones, but 
    the time cometh when not one stone shall be left on another, for the enemy 
    shall overthrow both the city and the temple.</p>
  <p>And some of the scribes, hearing him, sought to entangle him in his talk 
    and said, if thou wouldst put away the sacrifices of sheep and oxen and birds, 
    to what purpose was this Temple built for God by Solomon which has been FORTY 
    AND SIX years in restoring? (ADaM , 1 + 4 + 1 + 40 = 46). And Yeshu answered

    of Prayer for all nations, for the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. But 
    ye have made it a house of slaughter and filled it with abominations.</p>
  <p>But the True Temple is the body of man in which God dwelleth by the Spirit,

    to destroy the law but to fulfill it.</p>
  <p>Know ye not what is written? Obedience is better than sacrifice and to hearken

    5:10-14; 7:1-17). And they refused to listen and some said, he is inspired

    act again portray his callousness to the Rabbinic authorities and more so, 
    his blatant disregard for the general community at large who came to Jerusalem 
    to observe the Passover and rejoice. There is no way that a man running around 
    beating people with ropes can be considered anything other than a violent 
    disturbed personality. The disruption of the Passover holiday cannot be considered 
    anything other than an act of terrorism. Whatever happened to &quot;do not

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If, in Yeshu's eyes what 
    was happening in the temple was wrong, then following his own advice, he should 
    have prayed to G-d for change rather than act like a violent madman. With 
    regards to his zeal for the temple, zeal has to be properly placed in order 
    for it to be real, Breaking up the Divinely ordained order of providing for

    of war. Is God hungry? Politicians, merchants, priests and preachers, teachers

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Bar Tzadok): With regards 
    to Yeshu's warnings about bringing a sword to the earth, at least one of his 
    disciples took his words quite literally. John 18:2-11 portrays the events 
    of Yeshu's arrest. Verse 10 is most revealing: &quot;Simon Peter therefore 
    having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his 
    right ear.&quot;...By trade, Peter was a fisherman, not a soldier, yet he 
    was carrying a sword. Not only did he have a sword; he brandished it rather 
    quickly, and seemed to be quite expert in using it, being that he was able 
    to execute such a precise blow as chopping off an ear before being stopped.</font></p>

  <p>THE ORIGIN AND SOURCES OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</p>
  <p>&quot;While we do not know where or by whom the four New Testament gospels 
    were written, scholars realize that they are compilations assembled by what 
    we would today call editors, who drew on various traditions both oral and 
    written, of the early Christian communities. Because of this, the written 
    gospels originate from complex layers of earlier materials from a wide variety 
    of sources. These include collections of 'sayings of the Lord' (like the Gospel 
    of Thomas), collections of miracle stories used by early Christian missionaries, 
    dialogues attributed to Jesus, a passion narrative, miscellaneous legends, 
    and other special sources specific to individual gospels, to name the most 
    obvious. From a historical standpoint, this diversity of sources makes it 
    difficult to paint an accurate portrait of the historical Jesus. While there 
    are undoubtedly some historically reliable teachings and accounts of Jesus 
    in the New Testament, it's impossible to know which ones are and which ones 
    aren't. The fact was recognized long ago by the early church father Origen, 
    who pointed out that some incidents related in the gospels never took place 
    in a 'material' or 'corporeal' sense, but are spiritual allegories meant to 
    be studied as such; as he states quite clearly, 'the careful student may observe 
    countless other instances in the Gospels, and may thus be convinced that with 
    the historical events, literally true, different ones are interwoven which 
    never occurred.'&quot; <font size="2">A Study in New Testament Exegeses</font>.</p>
  <p>&quot;This is a noble intention, and it is not my purpose here to articulate 
    a quarrel with the Christian faith, or to call the evangelists liars, or to 
    assert that the Gospels have no historical content. I write as a literary 
    critic, not as debunker. The Gospels are, it must be said with gratitude, 
    works of art, the supreme fiction in our culture, narratives produced by enormously 
    influential literary artists who put their art in the service of a theological 
    vision...But what does it mean to say that the evangelists were literary artists? 
    Literary artists use their imaginations to produce poetry and fiction, works 
    open to literary criticism. The Gospels are, indeed--and to a much greater 
    degree than those who read them with pious inattention even begin to realize--imaginative 
    literature, fiction, and critics have been using such terms about them for 
    a long time. B.H. Streeter, for example, wrote more than a half century ago 
    about the role of 'creative imagination' in the composition of the Fourth 
    Gospel. Reginald Fuller has, more recently, examined the extent to which the 
    Resurrection narratives are the 'free creation' of the evangelists...</p>
  <p>As in the case mentioned above, the content of the Gospels is frequently 
    not 'Jesus' but what certain persons in the first century wanted us to think 
    about Jesus. In the language of the Fourth Gospel, <i>These (narratives) here 
    written have been recorded in order that you may hold the faith that Jesus 
    is the Christ, the Son of God.</i> (John 20:31). In the language of literary 
    criticism, the Gospels are self-reflexive; they are not about Jesus so much 
    as they are about their own attitudes concerning Jesus.</p>
  <p>That reflexive aspect of the Gospels is one of the main themes of this book. 
    I deal with the effort of the evangelists to present their work to us as self-conscious 
    literary documents, deliberately composed as a culmination of a literary and 
    oral tradition, echoing and recasting that tradition, both appealing to it 
    and transcending it, while using it in multiple ways, The Gospels are Hellenistic 
    religious narratives in the tradition of the Greek Septuagint version of the

  <p><i>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priests servant, 
    and cut off his Right ear. The servant's name was Malchus...</i>(John 17:10). 
  </p>
  <p><i>Then said Jesus</i> <i>unto him, Put up again thy sword unto his place: 
    for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</i></p>
  <p><i>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently 
    give me more than twelve legions of angels...</i>(Matthew 26:52,53).</p>

  <p><i>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have 
    delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</i></p>
  <p><i>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of 
    this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to 
    the Jews, but now is my kingdom not from hence...</i>(John 18:35,36).</p>

<p align="center">The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God...(Ephesians 
  6:10-17, KJV). </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Then said he unto them, but now, he that hath a purse let him take it, 
    and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment 
    and buy one.</i></p>
  <p><i>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished 
    in me </i><font size="2">(Isaiah 53)</font><i>, And he was reckoned among 
    the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</i></p>
  <p><i>And they said, Lord, behold, here are Two Swords. And he said unto them, 
    It is enough...</i>(Luke 22:36-38).</p>
  <p><i>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be 
    ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH</i>...(2 Timothy 2:15).</p>
  <p><i>For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
    sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the 
    joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the 
    heart...</i>(Hebrews 4:12).</p>
  <p>THE RIGHT EAR? (This just happens to be the Jewish side of the Tree. <i>Let 
    those who HAVE an ear let them hear</i>):</p>
  <p><i>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: 
    but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</i></p>
  <p><i>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not, and 
    hearing hear not, neither do they understand.</i></p>
  <p><i>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing 
    ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not 
    perceive.</i></p>
  <p><i>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, 
    and their eyes they have closed: lest at any time they should see with their 
    eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and 
    should be converted, and I should heal them...</i>(Matthew 13:10-15; Isaiah 
    6:9,10). </p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Bar Tzadoc): This behavior 
    of Peter should not surprise any knowledgeable Christian. Yeshu was known 
    to have surrounded himself with violent men. Two of his top twelve disciples 
    were known terrorists. There was Simon the Zealot (Matt.10:4, the term for 
    Zealot in Hebrew is 'kenai,' this is sometimes mistranslated as 'cananaean') 
    Then there was the infamous Judas Iscariot. What most do not know is that 
    the name 'Iscariot' was the Greek form of the Aramaic word 'sicarii.' The 
    word sicarii means a short sword or dagger. The term sicarii was not a name, 
    but a title used to describe the worst groups of zealots living during this 
    time. These sicarii zealots were known as 'assassins.' It was they they who 
    instigated the war with Rome and it was they who who eventually caused the 
    destruction of the temple and Jerusalem. In light of Yeshu's statements and 
    acts of violence, I find it no wonder that among his top disciples were members 
    of this most wicked group of misguided 'zealots,'&quot;</font></p>

    2:1-16).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Bar Tzadok): One other 
    point relating to the topic of violence I have found to be of interest. Matt.12:47-50 
    relates an episode where Yeshu's own mother comes to him and asks to see him. 
    <i>And someone said to him, Behold your mother and your brothers are standing 
    outside seeking to speak to you</i>. But he answered the one who was telling 
    him and said, <i>Who is my mother and who are my brothers? And stretching 
    out his hand toward his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren. 
    For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in Heaven, the same is 
    my brother and sister and mother</i>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rather than fulfill the 
    Biblical edict to honor one's parents, Yeshu chooses to ignore his own mother. 
    Not only is this type of response inappropriate and disrespectful, it is all 
    too familiar today to those who have lost loved ones to the growing number 
    of religious cults in the world. Cults today teach members to cut off all 
    outside connections with loved ones, who because they are not members of the 
    cult they are no longer to be considered as family. The detestable twisting 
    of the mind seems not to be anything new. Even Yeshu thought this way with 
    regards to his own family. While this is not physical violence, it is most 
    certainly emotional abuse. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Again, I ask you are 
    these the deeds of a messiah?</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Jesus said, Whoever does not hate his father </i></font>(one's 
    old natural ways)<font size="+1"><i> and his mother </i></font>(one's former

    whoever does not hate his brothers and sisters </i></font>(the ways of the 
    Right and the ways of the Left)<font size="+1"><i> and take up his cross in 
    my way will not be worthy of me...</i>(Gospel of Thomas 55).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Jesus said, Whoever does not hate his father and his mother 
    as I do cannot be a disciple to me. And whoever does not love his father and 
    his mother as I do cannot become a disciple to me. For my mother (is my old 
    nature) but my true mother gave me life...</font></i><font size="+1">(Gospel 
    of Thomas 101).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">__________</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and 
    his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene, </font></i>(all 
    literary figures in the great epic drama of redemption)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple 
    standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! and

    of Philip 59:5-10).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Jesus said to him, You do not realize who I am from what 
    I say to you, but you have become like the Jews, for they either love the

  <p><i><font size="+1">Jesus said, Whoever blasphemes against the father will

    will not be forgiven either on earth or in heaven</font></i><font size="+1">...(Gospel 
    of Thomas 43,44).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">YESHU AND PROPHECY</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Christianity has portrayed 
    Yeshu as being a great prophet, even greater than Moses. Yet, prophecy is 
    an exact science. Just because someone offers a prophecy does not make that 
    one a prophet. There are rules to prophecy that are outlined in the Bible. 
    This was necessary, for just as there is true prophecy, there also exists 
    false prophecy. With regards to telling the difference between true and false 
    prophecy, it is written in Deut.18:21-22:</font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When you say in your 
    heart, 'How can we know the word that G-d has not spoken?' If the prophet 
    will speak in the Name of G-d and that thing will not occur and not come about--that 
    is the word that G-d has not spoken; with willfulness has the prophet spoken 
    it, you should not fear him...</font></i></p>
  <p>Bar Tzadok goes on to cite the <i>fact</i> of Israel's return to its own 
    land, the <i>inevitable</i> victory of the Jewish people over their Arab foes 
    (because of God's certain favor for His Jewish people) and the eventual reconstruction 
    of the Temple in Jerusalem (and the return of animal sacrifices), as blaring 
    examples of the failure of Yeshu's words and the resulting collapse of the 
    Christian world-view. We will offer the whole of this <i>Commentary on the 
    Tree of Life</i>, and the reality of those things that are unfolding in the 
    earth at this present time, as proof-positive of the life and prophetic powers 
    of that one who Bar Tzadoc calls Yeshu. And we will conclude this chapter 
    with a blessing on all the children of Israel, Jew and Gentile alike: </p>
