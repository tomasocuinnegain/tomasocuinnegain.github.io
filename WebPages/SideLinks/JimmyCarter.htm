</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The day will declare it or not (see Deuteronomy 18:22), but 
  to suggest that Jimmy Carter is an antichrist is to those dwelling on the vast 
  spiritual surface of things, an absurdity. And how much more absurd and far-fetched 
  is it to state that he is <i>the Antichrist</i> himself, the one to whom the 
  fated number 600, 60, and 6 belongs. One is on slippery ground and open to every 
  intellectual, not to fail to mention political and religious attack just to 
  say so. How could this world-renowned individual answer to all the horrid descriptions 
  that have been imagined of the Antichrist all of these centuries? And even if 
  the number <i>Six hundred Sixty and Six </i>somehow associates itself with the 
  office of the American presidency in the 20th century (these might reason), 
  (and hasn't everyone always twisted these numbers to fit the names and personages 
  of a myriad of other historical figures throughout the centuries? they will 
  say), what could it have to do with Carter now? Is he not, as Douglas Brinkley 
  writes in <i>The Unfinished Presidency</i>, the only one of them in recent times 
  &quot;who is NOT criminally insane?&quot; Since leaving that office Carter has, 
  on the great and renowned surface of things, exemplified himself in ways that 
  no other President has, in ways it seems every Christian should--given the nature 
  of these times, and the character of those others who are presently in charge 
  of the world. He has even openly defined himself and his agenda in the language 
  of the Scriptures. (Of course this should have been a direct sign to more than 
  just a few). He has not shied away from proclaiming what appears to be--at least 
  in its ethical and social applications--the gospel of Christ (as it has emerged 
  out of his own Southern Baptist and American-capitalist worldview that is). 
  He has kept his moral bearings in a political world swirling with other opportunities...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Carter has lent his name, his organizational skills, and from 
  time to time even his own physical labors, to such causes as Habitat For Humanity. 
  Why wouldn't every thoughtful person want to trust and emulate him, and be involved 
  themselves in some such ways?...Yet for some reason many are not compelled to 
  it. And it has something intrinsically to do with what many can also see are 
  but mere spasms of humanitarianism emanating from those in the liberal establishment 
  and on the religious Left, that hardly, in the end, lead to the real changes 
  that are required in the structure of a society to make such efforts meaningful; 
  or that are required in the structure of each soul's real personal and economic 
  relationship to every other soul, in order to make such efforts not just truly 
  meaningful but revolutionary. Such humanitarian efforts certainly make us feel 
  good about ourselves (not to fail to mention how they can enhance a reputation). 
  They may even allow some to think that they are taking part in the process of 
  real spiritual transformation in the world. And in some sense they are, but 
  in the main these changes are more in keeping with the pulse of traditional 
  American liberalism than with the pulse of the Spirit who is rising up everywhere 
  in the world to shine a light on such half-meaningful and, for many, such self-serving 
  exercises.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth 
    through the Spirit unto UNFEIGNED LOVE of the brethren, see that ye love one 
    another with a pure heart fervently...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Peter 
    1:22). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We sacrifice, as it is, our own personal comforts, and even 
  our habit of being paid for our labors, for a week or so, or a weekend or two, 
  and nothing on the surface seems to be wrong with it. On the contrary, everything 
  seems to be right about it--save for the half-empty feeling so many are left 
  with afterwards. And this because we intuitively know that something vital is 
  missing. God's purposes, in some essential way, while they seemed to be served 
  were not entirely served. Despite the good intentions, and the real religious 
  motivations of many--and a good time was had by all (and reputations, as we 
  mentioned, were enhanced)--real spiritual Community was not attained. The brief 
  relationship between the wealthy donors and volunteers and impoverished recipients 
  were not really forged, or hammered together in a new alliance of heart and 
  mind, because the social and economic &quot;hegemony&quot; of the one group 
  over the other was not changed. The Gospel was not served because the world 
  remained the same, and this is the point of the matter. The motives of the sons 
  of Darkness (into whose grasps the children of Light often fall), are not aimed 
  at changing the world, but of only making this present world better--for themselves, 
  and for those who participate in their world view. The difference is critical. 
  The children of Light--those who increasingly, as Paul said, find themselves 
  troubled on every side--seek not only for a complete renewal of the human heart 
  but for a complete overhaul of the world's institutions as well--for the kingdom 
  of God to arrive on earth, not for the kingdom of man to supplant it. The very 
  best of the children of Darkness strive to merely reform this present world, 
  while remaining content to leave its institutions, in which they have a great 
  personal stake, and its old ways of doing business intact.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From </font><font size="+1"> May 18th to the 20th (2001), there 
  was a Conference on Prophecy being held at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine 
  in New York City. The speakers inside the conference were among many of the 
  leading scientific and religious thinkers of our day. At the same time there 
  was another gathering of churchmen and women letting out, a casual parade of 
  be-collared and be-ornamented obviously mainline Protestant ministers, all liberal 
  in demeanor, in conversation and in appearance. As the group passed by, without 
  so much as an inquisitive glance at the conversation that was happening on the 
  street outside (after all, what could they possibly learn from outside their 
  own enlightened conference, and from the &quot;unordained&quot; no less)? one 
  was left with a parade of impressions running through their mind (generalizations 
  of course, but nevertheless): proud, elitist, uniquisitive and unimaginative, 
  rational (to a fault), well-heeled, financially secure, self-certain, intellectually 
  arrogant, content in their own company, in a word, Carteresque. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One woman from the prophecy conference asked why this conversation 
  was being held out here on the street, and not inside. We agreed that it was 
  one thing to talk about God, and about the oppressed and those who are out of 
  the way, and to spend some of one's own life devising programs to benefit the 
  poor and the disenfranchised, but it was quite another thing to share the same 
  living space as the poor and the working class, the same real-life conditions 
  and experiences, the same sense of exclusion. When I mentioned to her that it 
  was in the dynamic of the streets, and not in the hallowed halls of academia, 
  or in the chambers of those lovely traditional and mainline churches that fill 
  the American landscape, that the real conversations of Life, and of God, and 
  of prophecy, were taking place, she said &quot;thank you.&quot;</font></p>

  <p align="center">WELCOME TO THE CARTER CENTER</p>
  <p>Every day in countries all over the world, people live under difficult, life-threatening 
    circumstances caused by war, disease, famine, and poverty. The non-profit 
    Carter Center strives to relieve this suffering by advancing peace and health 
    in neighborhoods and nations around the globe.</p>
  <p>The Center, in partnership with Emory University, is guided by a fundamental 
    commitment to human rights, wages peace by bringing warring parties to the 
    negotiating table, monitoring elections, safeguarding human rights, and building 
    strong democracies through economic development.</p>
  <p>It sows the seeds of peace in other ways--by fighting disease, increasing 
    crop production, and promoting preventive health care in the United States 
    and abroad.The goal is to help create a world where very man, woman, and child 
    has the opportunity to enjoy good health and live in peace.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Office

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is true (and our own natural and liberal impulse is to say 
  God bless his soul for it, and we do), Carter has intervened and used his political 
  influence in the world to alleviate the agony of perhaps millions afflicted 
  with the dreaded guinea-worm disease. This is a painful and life-threatening 
  condition contracted when the larvae of this worm enters the body through, what 
  was for so many, the almost unavoidable use of unsanitary and infected water 
  sources. The Carter Center was able to marshall the energies and the political 
  will of those nations afflicted with such conditions; and, using the material 
  and simple technological resources of the West, was able to almost eradicate 
  the disease in those areas. And along with others, he has concerned himself 
  with the AIDS crisis in Africa. So what is to criticize? On the surface, absolutely 
  nothing--aside from the words: <i>...But the tender mercies of the wicked are 
  cruel</i>. (Proverbs 12:10). And aside, that is, from the remaining scope of 
  Carter's global agenda, his otherwise, not so spiritually benign association 
  with the powers of this world. Thus the fact that he will also find himself 
  in a position to assist in arousing and marshaling the reactive energies of 
  the Western economic (thus the political and military) order as well in a time 
  of global crisis. (And we are referring to those global crises that God Himself 
  is presently visiting upon the earth as it is written: <i>I will overturn, overturn, 
  overturn, it...until he come whose right it is; and I will give it to him</i>...Ezekiel 
  21:27). Jimmy Carter thinks in three dimensions, not four; he is a man of this 
  age, and of this present world. And because he is not a son of the age that 
  is a-borning, or of the world to come, he finds room in his imagination for 
  the thinking of such other fellow luminaries as Zbigniew Brzezinski: </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the end of the cold war and

    After some 50 years during which foreign affairs commanded the highest priority 
    in Washington and on television and the front page, the subject has virtually 
    disappeared for most Americans.</font><b> </b>(And this was true in a sense, 
    until September 11th, 2001. Nevertheless the <i>neo-cons</i> of the Reagan-Bush

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is true from top to bottom. 
    President Clinton clearly pays as little attention to foreign affairs as he

    the public cares less and less about what they have to say. But they keep 
    saying it anyway. And some are saying with increasing alarm: Wake up, America, 
    before its too late.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of those most troubled by the 
    sudden turn in American attitudes is Zbigniew Brzezinski, who from 1977 to 
    1981 was President Jimmy Carter's national security advisor, and who has for 
    years been one of the more provocative thinkers about foreign affairs, particularly 
    those dealing with the former Soviet bloc. What has bothered Brzezinski is 
    that as a result of the Soviet collapse, the United States is the unquestionable 
    world leader, unchallenged for the moment by any other power. But American 
    democracy does not lend itself well to the running of empires. This has frustrated 
    Brzezinski, who has now provided another scholarly blueprint for what he believes 
    the United States should do in the coming years to further American interests, 
    maintain the hegemony it commands and prevent global anarchy. For Brzezinski 
    this is a strategic game, not unlike chess, TO OUTWIT POTENTIAL RIVALS, and 
    hence the title of the book: <i>The Grand Chessboard</i>....</font></p>

    2:4,5).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...This is not the first time Brzezinski 
    has touched on this theme. Eleven years ago he published &quot;The Game Plan: 
    A Geostrategic Framework for the Conduct of the U.S.-Soviet Contest.&quot; 
    And just four years ago, in the aftermath of the Soviet disintegration, he 
    wrote: &quot;Out of Control: Global Turmoil on the Eve of the Twenty-first 
    Century,&quot; which many saw as a counter to the optimistic view of the future 
    in <i>The End of History and the Last Man</i>, by Francis Fukuyama...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski, who writes convincingly 
    if a bit inelegantly, describes a very forbidding situation in the years ahead 
    if the United States does not make more permanent the dominance it now has 
    over a vast area of the world. &quot;This huge oddly-shaped Eurasian chessboard--extending 
    from Lisbon to Vladivostok--provides the setting for the game,&quot; Brzezinski 
    says. &quot;IF THE MIDDLE SPACE CAN BE DRAWN INCREASINGLY INTO THE EXPANDING 
    ORBIT OF THE WEST (where America preponderates), if the southern region is 
    not subjected to domination by a single player, and if the East is not unified

    AMERICA CAN THEN BE SAID TO PREVAIL...</font></p>

  the process began in the time of Christ, with the words at 2 Thessalonians 2:7, 
  KJV; or rather, it began in the garden of Eden when Eve conceived and said: 
  <i>I have gotten a man from the Lord</i>...Genesis 4:1; Job 3:1-6). They are:

  fully concern ourselves shortly.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1>In his work, <i>Sources of Strength, Meditations on Scripture 
  For a Living Faith</i>, in a chapter entitled "What it takes to Be a Christian," 
  Carter speaks of his faith in Jesus Christ. He speaks of Christ's Plan of Salvation; 
  of the presence of the Holy Spirit in people's lives; and "The simple but profound 
  fact that our lives can be changed--beginning now--by professing our faith in 
  Jesus Christ." Well what can these things mean in the context of Carter's American 
  ethos? outside of his belief that if we give our lives over to Christ we will 
  transformed into ideal Americans ourselves. In the chapter entitled "A Humble 
  Servant" he quotes the verse: <i>But he that is greatest among you shall be 
  your servant</i>. (Matthew 23:11). He also quotes from the chapter in Isaiah

  apocalyptic dimensions of God's revelation, choosing only those texts that suit 
  his own personal ambitions (thus betraying his inability to perceive the presence 
  of God in all of these unfolding realities), believes in essence that he is

    have relentlessly stalked the Antichrist over the past few decades. Most sightings 
    have taken the form of foreign leaders. The principle targets have continued 
    to be Soviet politicians, Arab statesmen, or European aristocrats deemed likely 
    to become leaders in the European Economic Community. All such efforts to 
    ferret out the Beast share Dave Hunt's assumption that:</font></p>

      certainly alive--biding his time, awaiting his cue... Already a mature man, 
      he is probably active in politics, perhaps even an admired world leader

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They also share Hunt's intuitive 
    feel for the key quality or identifying trait that will reveal the Beast's 
    sinister nature. HIS PUBLIC PROFESSION OF TOLERANCE, PLURALISM, ONE-WORLDISM, 
    GLOBAL PEACE, AND ECOLOGICAL PURITY. ALL OF THEE, HUNT INSISTS IN HIS <i>Global 
    Peace and the Rise of Antichrist</i> ARE ALL HALLMARKS OF THE ANTICHRIST. 
    All belie an antipathy for the theological absolutes and rigid social boundaries

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hunt's identification of globalism, 
    peace, and tolerance as 'the horrifying image of the Antichrist' tells us

    status of the Beast. Each Antichrist candidate has in some way been connected 
    with the kinds of late-twentieth-century political, economic, and cultural 
    trends that premillennialists find objectionable. Hunt, for example, concedes 
    that there are sound economic and political reasons for promoting a more global

    OF WORLD UNITY IS NECESSARY TO RESCUE THE ENTIRE PLANET FROM ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSE.

    BUT, HUNT WARNS, THESE ARE THE REASONINGSS OF ANTICHRIST: 'UNLESS ONE IS A

<p><font size=+1>The great difference that exists between the nationalistic doctrines 
  of American fundamentalists (the fearful-looking and largely isolationist doctrines 
  of the Conservative Right), and the Christianity of Jimmy Carter is that Carter's 
  vision is closer to that of Christ's than their's. It is exactly this <i>nearness</i> 
  (and particularly in the mind of Carter himself) that makes him the one. (As 
  for the Right-wing of the American church, everyone but the Christian Right 
  itself can see how this modern phenomena has grown here in the West, not only 
  in the ways of national, but also in the ways of personal self-interest, greed, 
  cock-suredness, outright condemnation of others, and that it has become the 
  fast friend of vested conservative American economic and military interests--in 
  a word: <i>entangled</i> in all of the complexities of evil). Like that of the 
  true Anointed Ones, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter's world-view does indeed transcend 
  national boundaries, and it certainly transcends the narrow literalism of the 
  Conservative Right--but in the opposite, and just as twisted, mainstream intellectual 
  way of the religious Left. However, unlike the rest of the Intellectual Left 
  (understanding the mind of Jimmy Carter is like solving for X), Jimmy Carter 
  truly believes that the spirit of Christ should rule the world. It is just that 
  he does not believe in the literal coming of Christ as do others (and has no 
  time, nor inclinations for such speculations), and therefore does not believe 
  in the notion of <i>Antichrist</i> either, outside of the general and collective 
  state of unbelief and social unrepentence that exists everywhere in the world 
  around him. Jimmy and Rosalynn could be the true Messiahs (they have the relationship, 
  the impulse, and the resolve), if they were not American nationalists, capitalists 
  and militarists (which Jimmy Carter pretends not to be), and if Jimmy Carter's 
  personal worldview was rooted in the Torah instead of in the myths and the history 
  of the American nation (Deuteronomy 4:7-10):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size=+1>Lest there be among you a man...whose heart turneth away

<p><font size="+1">Something fiercely debilitating happened between the time of 
  Roger Williams and to the doctrines of Roger Williams, who--though perhaps the 
  first European on American soil to champion the right of absolute free expression 
  of thought, and of the right to follow one's own spiritual conscience in the 
  face of <i>both</i> church and state--most assuredly would not have participated 
  in the violent affairs of the American revolution </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font><font size="+1">...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was inevitable that Baptist 
    ideas would be carried to the American colonies, where Puritans had been given 
    their own colony in Massachusetts. The seeds were sown while Roger Williams 
    grew up in England. Williams lived near Newgate Prison and saw ghastly executions 
    of Baptists and other &quot;heretics&quot; for no crimes other than dissent. 
    He also knew that the bloody conflict (the Thirty Years War) then raging on 
    the Continent was between church-state regimes, battling to gain control of 
    subject's minds...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A letter came from the Puritan 
    congregation in Boston inquiring whether Williams would be interested in becoming 
    their pastor. He knew that the Puritans had gone to Massachusetts to worship 
    God according to their conscience. He hoped he would be permitted to preach 
    what he could not in England.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Williams was not long in Boston 
    before he realized that the Puritans wanted religious freedom only for themselves. 
    They were more intolerant of dissenters than their Anglican cousins. He refused 
    their pastoral call, explaining, 'I durst not officiate to an unseparated 
    people.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Williams took the pulpit of the 
    liberal Salem church, which was then in rebellion against the powers in Boston. 
    The Salem Puritans agreed with him that civil powers shouldn't be used to 
    control conscience. (The Puritan fathers of the holy commonwealth saw it differently. 
    They had been sent by God to build the New Israel in America. They were the 
    agents of the theocracy, the enforcers of God's law, judge, jury, and executioner).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Williams said all the things the 
    English Baptists had been saying and more. He attacked the Puritan laws against 
    violation of the first table of the Ten Commandments. Whether a man worshipped 
    a god or no god, Williams said, swore or never took an oath, went to church 
    on the Sabbath or went fishing was none of the state's business...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if this wasn't insult enough 
    to the holy commonwealth, Williams preached to the aborigines that God loved 
    them as much as He did proper Englishmen. When he found what the Indians had 
    been paid for their lands, he gave the back of his hand to the Puritans for 
    cheating.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wigged heads in Boston could 
    tolerate his meddling with the Indians; they needed his help in persuading 
    the Indians not to attack. But calls for &quot;absolute permission of conscience...in 
    what is spiritual&quot; were intolerable. They passed a law requiring all 
    citizens of the commonwealth to take an oath of loyalty to the general court. 
    Refusal was punishable by banishment. Williams thundered that the law was 
    illegal and unjust. He was promptly arrested and put on trial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Convicted, he was offered a chance 
    to recant. He replied defiantly, 'I shall be ready...not only to be bound 
    and banished, but to die also in New England for my convictions and for the 
    truth as I see it.' </font></p>
  <p>(What Williams in essence said, was that the church had no authority whatsoever 
    over the private or civil lives of individuals, especially if such individuals 
    considered themselves outside of the church itself. But also, and more critically, 
    that the duly elected civil powers had absolutely no right in turn to govern 
    over, or to counterdict an individual's sense of his or her's own responsibility 
    to God. Williams set the individual conscience above both church and state).</p>
  <p>(Later)<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Providence, Williams 
    was free to set up his own church...Thus was born in 1639 the first Baptist 
    church in America, and it is still in existence.&quot;</font><b> </b>The Church

  more than a century later still hammering away for this right of free expression. 
  For by this time they had clearly diminished and confounded the high intent 
  and spirit of William's resistance to the established order by entangling themselves, 
  and their congregations, in the now purely political, secular, and mercantile 
  causes of a new &quot;established order,&quot; <i>One newly risen up</i>. If 
  their own cause was still a spiritual one in their own eyes the sanctity of

  claims descent from the Baptists of the time of Christ (for this is what present-day 
  Baptists claim of themselves) or even from Roger Williams (who others say was 
  the last true Baptist in America), his spirit and his doctrines are clearly

    to many of the young rebels of the sixties by his promise to cut the military

    support from the leaders of key institutions.' Brzezinski, a traditional cold 
    war intellectual, became Carter's National Security Advisor. His Secretary 
    of Defense, Harold Brown, had, during the Vietnam War, according to the 'Pentagon

    obviously aggressive. Hence the emphasis on 'human rights.' the pressure put 
    on South Africa and Chile to liberalize their policies. BUT ON CLOSE EXAMINATION,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another fundamental of foreign 
    policy, whether Democrats or Republicans were in the White House, WAS THE

    THOUSANDS OF MILITARY LEADERS (Death Squads) IN LATIN AMERICA HAD GRADUATED. 
    Six of the graduates, for instance, were in the Chilean military junta that

  <p>Dear President Carter,</p>
  <p>Over the weekend, you were quoted in the Columbus Ledger-Inquirer as saying, 
    &quot;I have the greatest personal respect for President George Bush, and 
    also understand the difficulties and challenges of a new president.&quot; 
    You made this comment several days after you were quoted in the same newspaper 
    criticizing Bush for his position on missile defense, Alaskan oil drilling, 
    and global warming. </p>
  <p>It had been gratifying, however briefly, to hear you speak the truth about 
    this corrupt prostitute for Big Business. That makes it even more infuriating 
    to see you now gutlessly back down. When you say that you have &quot;the greatest 
    personal respect&quot; for Bush, is this deadpan satire? Or do you literally 
    mean that your respect for him is unsurpassed by your respect for Dr. Martin 
    Luther King, Jr.? Dr. King risked his life to guarantee that African Americans 
    would have the right to vote and to have their votes count. The man for whom 
    you have :the greatest personal respect&quot; deliberately prevented many 
    black Floridians from exercising the rights that Dr. King worked so bravely 
    to win for them....</p>
  <p>Do you respect him because he lied about his tax cut for the rich, and because 
    republicans now plan to raid Social Security and Medicare in order to have 
    the elderly subsidize that immoral giveaway? Do you respect him because he 
    lied about the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; and helped Kenneth Lay and the Texas 
    Natural Gas Mafia steal billions of dollars from defenseless consumers?...Do 
    you respect him in spite of these things, or because of them?</p>
  <p>Bush has appointed devotees of the Confederacy to his cabinet. Did this increase 
    your respect for him? He has made an all-out assault on the environment. He 
    lied about curbing carbon emissions. He decided in favor of more arsenic in 
    the drinking water. He has okayed dumping of more industrial toxins into America's 
    potable water supply. All the while he has deceitfully called himself an &quot;avid 
    environmentalist.&quot;</p>
  <p>He pledged to &quot;leave no child behind,&quot; then ruthlessly slashed 
    funding for pediatric hospitals, day care facilities, reading programs, and 
    child abuse prevention centers. President Carter, what does someone have to 
    do in order to lose your &quot;greatest personal respect?&quot;...</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By Jay Nordlinger, 
  National Review</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All right, I&#146;ve got Carter 
    on my mind, so look out. Why Carter? Didn&#146;t he leave office in 1981 (the 
    same day the mullahs decided to spring the hostages, lest RR send a few up 
    you-know-where)? Yes, but he&#146;s back in the news, yapping absurdly about 
    the Middle East and getting ready to visit Castro down in Cuba (May 12 to 
    May 17).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For several days, I rooted around 
    in all things Carter, preparing for a piece that appears in the new NR (&#147;There 
    He Goes Again: Jimmy Carter, Our &#145;Model Ex-President&#146;&#148;)...I, 
    personally, have always been sort of fascinated by the man (and his family, 
    and his home environs). I suppose I&#146;ve read just about everything significant 
    ever written about him. (Does anyone know what the phrase &#147;Lordy, Lordy, 
    Jim Jack Gordy&#148; could possibly mean? If so, you are a fellow Carterologist.) 
    I have followed Jimmy C. since the Democratic primaries of 1976. The other 
    day, in conversation with someone, I described his chronicler Douglas Brinkley 
    as &#147;a great admirer of Carter who&#146;s not blind to his faults.&#148; 
    I suppose I&#146;d describe myself as a great critic of Carter&#146;s who&#146;s 
    not blind to his virtues. Anyway, let&#146;s Carter away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For years, Carter has been a thorn 
    in the side of presidents, acting as a kind of &#147;anti-president,&#148; 
    as Lance Morrow once put it in an essay for Time. You recall how Carter irked 
    Clinton on Haiti and North Korea. His low moment, however, came during the 
    run-up to the Gulf War, when he wrote members of the U.N. Security Council 
    &#151; including Mitterrand&#146;s France and Communist China &#151; urging 
    them to thwart the Bush administration&#146;s effort. Our government found 
    out about it when the Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, called the 
    defense secretary, Dick Cheney, and said, &#147;What the . . .?&#148; Some 
    people actually allowed themselves to utter the word &#147;treason.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes, Carter says he would 
    never act at odds with the government; at other times, he talks about a higher 
    law, a duty to conscience, etc. EITHER WOULD BE FINE: BUT THE EX-PRESIDENT 
    DOESN'T STICK TO ONE OR THE OTHER.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CARTER HAS LONG ENJOYED A REPUTATION 
    AS A MIDDLE EAST SAGE, owing, of course, to his role in the original Camp 
    David accords. That reputation, however, rests on shaky grounds. Truth is, 
    Sadat and Begin had their deal worked out before ever approaching Washington. 
    And the facilitators they used were far from saintly Southern Baptists: They 
    used the dreadful King of Morocco and the even more dreadful Ceausescu of 
    Romania! When they had their plan essentially worked out, however, they called 
    the White House (WHOSE OCCUPANT JUST HAPPENED TO BE J.C.) (initials not accidental, 
    he and his most fervent admirers have seemed to think for years). Why did 
    they contact the White House? Prof. Bernard Lewis put it succinctly to Charlie 
    Rose recently: &#147;Well, obviously, they needed someone to pay the bill, 
    and who but the United States could fulfill that function?&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, CARTER IS PROUD-AS-ALL-GET-OUT 
    of his rendezvous with Middle East history. He trades on it incessantly. I 
    remember Mario Cuomo, giving his famous...keynote address at the Democratic 
    convention in 1984. He went down a list of Democratic presidents, lauding 
    them: and when he got to Carter, all he could think of, apparently, was Camp 
    David &#151; the &#147;nearly miraculous&#148; accords, he called them. CARTER, 
    in the stands, BEAMED AND BEAMED, and teared up badly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER KNOWN, 
    OR KNOWN OF, SOMEONE WHO SO NAKEDLY LOVED PRAISE. I saw him on C-SPAN once, 
    appearing on a radio show (if you know what I mean). This was a call-in show 
    somewhere, and the cameras were on Carter. One elderly caller began her question 
    with a long paean to the ex-president and his special human greatness. CARTER 
    ENJOYED IT IN A TRULY UNSEEMLY FASHION, grinning and grinning, seeming to 
    draw his very life from it. IT WAS PERFECTLY HUMAN&#151; PERFECTLY NATURAL&#151; 
    but obscene in a way. I felt almost as though I had to look away: like I was 
    seeing something too private, something I wasn&#146;t meant to see...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ex-president has always considered 
    himself screwed out of the Nobel prize, and he and his Carter Center have 
    campaigned rather embarrassingly openly for it. He has won prizes, however, 
    about which he crows: There was one named after his fellow liberal southerner, 
    Fulbright; there was one from the U.N. (natch); and there was my favorite: 
    the Zayed International Prize for the Environment, named for His Highness 
    Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates! Arabs are heavy-duty 
    funders of the Carter Center, and they get a lot for their money.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one quite realizes just how 
    passionately anti-Israel Carter is. William Safire has reported that Cyrus 
    Vance acknowledged that, if he had had a second term, Carter would have sold 
    Israel down the river. In the 1990s, Carter became quite close to Yasser Arafat. 
    After the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia was mad at Arafat, because the PLO chief 
    had sided with Saddam Hussein. So Arafat asked Carter to fly to Riyadh to 
    smooth things over with the princes and restore Saudi funding to him &#151; 
    which Carter did...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In The Unfinished Presidency, Brinkley 
    writes, &#147;There was no world leader Jimmy Carter was more eager to know 
    than Yasir Arafat.&#148; The former president &#147;felt certain affinities 
    with the Palestinian: a tendency toward hyperactivity and a workaholic disposition 
    with unremitting sixteen-hour days, seven days a week, decade after decade.&#148; 
    Neat, huh? At their first meeting &#151; in 1990 &#151; Carter boasted of 
    his toughness toward Israel, assuring Arafat at one point, &#147;. . . you 
    should not be concerned that I am biased. I am much more harsh with the Israelis.&#148; 
    Arafat, for his part, railed against the Reagan administration and its alleged 
    &#147;betrayals.&#148; Rosalynn Carter, taking notes for her husband, interjected, 
    &#147;You don&#146;t have to convince us!&#148; Brinkley records that this 
    &#147;elicited gales of laughter all round.&#148; Carter himself, according 
    to Brinkley, &#147;agreed that the Reagan administration was not renowned 
    as promise keepers&#148;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After Carter had that first meeting 
    with Arafat, he went home and promptly served the PLO head as PR adviser and 
    speechwriter. What do I mean? Listen to Brinkley: &#147;On May 24 Carter drafted 
    on his home computer the strategy and wording for a generic speech Arafat 
    was to deliver soon for Western ears . . .&#148; Said Carter, &#147;THE AUDIENCE 
    IS NOT THE SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT THE WORLD COMMUNITY. The objective of the 
    speech should be to secure maximum sympathy and support of other world leaders 
    . . . The Likud leaders are now on the defensive, and must not be given any 
    excuse for continuing their present abusive policies.&#148;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are a little clearer now. 
    Carter&#146;s op-ed piece for the New York Times last month &#151; April 21 
    &#151; was a nasty piece of work, an apologia for Arafat (despite a pro forma 
    and unconvincing attempt at &#147;balance&#148;) and a mendacious attack on 
    Sharon and Israel. His hatred for Sharon is deep, obvious, and personal. At 
    times he seems to use the man as a proxy for Israel: in other words, it&#146;s 
    okay openly to despise Sharon, if it&#146;s slightly less okay openly to despise 
    Israel. He refers to Sharon&#146;s &#147;invasion&#148; of Egypt and his &#147;invasion&#148; 
    of Lebanon. Of course, Meir was prime minister in the one instance, and Begin 
    was prime minister in the other. Sharon was a general or defense minister. 
    Carter also forgets the annoying little detail that Israel is a democracy, 
    and that the people of that country democratically elected Sharon their prime 
    minister. This is in sharp contrast to the Arab states, plus the P.A., that 
    Carter admires and excuses....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of his piece, Carter 
    calls &#151; no surprise &#151; for an American crackdown on our ally, Israel: 
    Silence its weapons, threaten its aid. Carter then writes, &#147;I understand 
    the extreme political sensitivity in America of using persuasion on the Israelis&#148; 
    &#151; which, to me, sounds an awful lot like, &#147;Sure, that blasted Jewish 
    lobby controls U.S. policy, as it always has &#151; except maybe for the shining 
    years of 1977 to 1981.&#148; Really disgusting, this effort, and utterly revealing 
    of Carter...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a 1997 op-ed piece entitled 
    &#147;It&#146;s Wrong to Demonize China&#148; (also for the New York Times), 
    Carter wrote &#151; and forgive the awkward prose &#151; &#147;American criticism 
    of China&#146;s human rights abuses are justified, but their basis is not 
    well understood. Westerners emphasize personal freedoms, while a stable government 
    and a unified nation are paramount to the Chinese. This means that policies 
    are shaped by fear of chaos from unrestrained dissidents or fear of China&#146;s 
    fragmentation by an independent Taiwan or Tibet. The result is excessive punishment 
    [excessive punishment!] of outspoken dissidents and unwarranted domination 
    of Tibetans.&#148;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the same piece, Carter came 
    very close to claiming that freedom of religion had come to China &#151; causing 
    activists in the field, who know the wretched truth, to groan in pain. In 
    a 1999 op-ed piece (USA Today) called &#147;Let&#146;s Keep Chinese Spying 
    in Perspective,&#148; Carter said that &#147;some . . . American leaders, 
    who have habitually demonstrated animosity toward the People&#146;s Republic 
    of China [note the mimicking of the Communists&#146; own false description 
    of themselves], have attempted to drive a deeper wedge between our two countries 
    at what is already a troubled time.&#148; Anyone who doesn&#146;t demonstrate 
    &#147;animosity&#148; toward that horrible state, Realpolitik or no, is no 
    friend to mankind...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He did even better in North Korea, 
    singing praises to Kim Il Sung, one of the most complete and destructive dictators 
    in history. Kim&#146;s North Korea, as Kirkpatrick says, was, and is, truly 
    a &#147;psychotic state.&#148; Said Carter of the &#147;Great Leader,&#148; 
    &#147;I find him to be vigorous, intelligent, surprisingly well informed about 
    the technical issues, and in charge of the decisions about this country&#148; 
    (well, he was absolute ruler). He said, &#147;I don&#146;t see that they [the 
    North Koreans] are an outlaw nation.&#148; Pyongyang, he observed, was a &#147;bustling 
    city,&#148; where shoppers &#147;pack the department stores,&#148; reminding 
    him of the &#147;Wal-Mart in Americus, Georgia.&#148;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Carter is not completely blinkered 
    when it comes to brutal dictators. Here&#146;s what he said to his interviewer 
    and admirer James Zogby (one of America&#146;s foremost PLO advocates) in 
    2001: &#147;I think the sanctions are hurting the people of Iraq, and not 
    Saddam Hussein, whom I consider to be a dictator, and I think an insensitive 
    dictator [!], and he is able now to blame all of his maybe self-induced problems 
    [&#147;maybe self-induced&#148;!], economically and socially, on the United 
    States because of our sanctions and because of our fairly infrequent aerial 
    attacks.&#148; Friends and foes can agree on one thing: THERE'S NO ONE LIKE 
    CARTER. NO ONE.<br>

<p><font size="+1">In a work entitled, <i>Cycles of War, The Next Six Years</i>, 
  the author, R. E. McMaster Jr.--in addition to describing the details of Presidential 
  Executive Order 11921, which continued (up until the present Homeland Security 
  measures being put in place) to ensure the President dictatorial authority to 
  suspend all constitutional guarantees and to enact marshall law in the event 
  of national crises--quotes from Murray N. Rothbard's article in <i>Reason</i> 
  magazine, &quot;The Conspiracy Theory of History Revisited&quot;:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Any time a hard-nosed analysis 
    is put forth of who our rulers are, of how their political and economic interests 
    interlock, it is invariably denounced by Establishment liberals and conservatives 
    as a 'conspiracy theory of history,' 'paranoid,' 'economic determinist,' and 
    even 'Marxist.' These smear labels are applied across the board...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Dr. Rothbard goes on to comment that the conspiracy analyst 
  is a realist in the sense that they believe folks tend to act in their own self-interest, 
  and that the use of government can be a very helpful means of achieving one's 
  ends. It is naive to believe that a series of events in government, &quot;are 
  random and unplanned, and that therefore people do not engage in purposive choice 
  and planning:&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...&quot;Dr. Rothbard notes, for 
    a case in point, that even the major newsweeklies have commented on the fact 
    that almost all of the top leadership in Carter's administration are members 
    of the elite Trilateral Commission, which was founded by David Rockefeller 
    in 1973. The purpose of the Trilateral Commission is to formulate policies 
    in the unified best interest of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe...and/or 
    members of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. Mr. Carter, Mondale, and 
    important members of the Coca-Cola company, Georgia's largest corporation, 
    are all members of the Trilateral Commission...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Rothbard concludes...'Was 
    Jimmy Carter named a member of the Trilateral Commission as soon as it was 
    founded because Rockefeller and others wanted to hear the wisdom of an obscure 
    Georgia governor? Or was he plucked out of obscurity and made President by 
    their support? Was J. Paul Austin, head of Coca-Cola, an early supporter of 
    Jimmy Carter merely out of concern for the common good? Were all the Trilateralists...chosen 
    by Carter simply because he felt they were the ablest people for the job? 
    If so, it's a coincidence that boggles the mind. OR ARE THERE MORE SINISTER 
    POLITICAL-ECONOMIC INTERESTS INVOLVED? I SUBMIT THAT THOSE WHO STUBBORNLY 
    REFUSE TO EXAMINE THE INTERPLAY OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN GOVERNMENT 
    ARE TOSSING AWAY THE ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR ANALYZING THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE.'&quot;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size=+1>There are in reality no clandestine human organizations, or cartels 
  of wealthy and powerful men, plotting in the darkened boardrooms of the Western 
  world to overthrow the plan of God. These men are oblivious to it all, and do 
  not even know that God has a plan. There is ultimately only one Conspirator 
  in the Universe, God. And God's plotting throughout the course of human history 
  has been aimed at the very heart and mind of Darkness itself. God would have 
  us see at last that this spirit of Darkness is absolutely incapable of considering 
  and comprehending the Presence and the Nature of Higher Reality. <i>They pay 
  no heed to the hidden meaning of what is actually taking place...</i> says the 
  document named <i>The Coming Doom, </i>in the Dead Sea Scriptures. Thus what 
  appears at ground level to be an unfolding (and quite marvelously timed) conspiracy 
  to concentrate economic and political, and military power in the hands of Western 
  globalists and internationalists, so that they--moving ever so stealthily with 
  the current of changing events--might assure that the coming age is established 
  upon the foundation of their own continuing self-interest (be they economic 
  or religious), is really not that at all. What we are actually witnessing is 
  the full historical effect of the words in Matthew 13:24-43, where the <i>tares</i> 
  are being bound in bundles. That is, where all the Sons of Darkness are being 
  bound together--along with all those who yield to them, who participate in their 
  world-view, and who agree in the end to go to war for them--into common states 
  of mind, to be consumed in the judgments that are now already being visited 
  upon the earth. </font></p>
<p><font size=+1>God (who is as Terrible as Nature itself, who dwells in the Sum 
  of all natural and human events), is calling all the forces of Darkness (Gog 
  and Magog--America and her allies) to their Feet, and summoning them to come 
  up and meet Him in the great age-ending battle. The whole Western Order, the 
  Realm of Antichrist, has come to its perfection now. It stands completely in 
  opposition to the emerging spiritual Order, one that is engaged in its own birth-process 
  at this very moment in time. (Isaiah 66; 1 Thessalonians 5). The office of the 
  American presidency (without which this birth process could not have come to 
  its perfect conclusion), and those who have occupied it, stand in direct opposition 
  to the spirit of Christ in the Earth. (See Ephesians 4:13,14). McMaster's words, 
  though written during the Carter years in the White House, still ring ominous 
  and true:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Probabilities indicate that 
    the U.S. Ship of State will sail into a hurricane within six years, the captain 
    of the ship is 'tailor made' to assume the dictatorial powers already in place...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Carter's political base is 
    the awesome cartel of corporation and banking interests, supported by the 
    Eastern Educational Establishment and upper echelon of Labor which brought 
    him to power. He meets the qualifications demanded by the public that Dr. 
    McClelland listed as necessary for a crisis and warfare leader. He is at the 
    right place at the right time...Mr. Carter's skilled use of communications 
    in this electronic age is unsurpassed. His absence of political debt...enables 
    him to move independently. His stubbornness, his natural preference to work 
    alone with attention to detail, concentrates the power in the White House, 
    (or wherever Mr. Carter happens to be). MR. CARTER'S ENTREPRENEURIAL ABILITY, 
    HIS COLD, CALCULATING AND POTENTIALLY RUTHLESS MODUS OPERANDI ARE BEFITTING 
    A DICTATOR. His strict upbringing, his strong discipline, reinforced by his 
    scientific training and military education...qualify him for military crisis 
    management. The evolution to a concentration of power in the White House is 
    a U.S. parallel of the development of Caesarism in Rome. History, therefore, 
    is on his side. Last, but not least, MR. CARTER'S SOUTHERN BAPTIST 'GOD IS 
    ON MY SIDE' MENTAL ATTITUDE FREES HIM FROM DOUBTING AND QUESTIONING HIS DECISIONS. 
    Professor E.E. Jennings of Michigan State University, an expert on executive 
    behavior and a longtime 'President-Watcher,' stated of Mr. Carter, '...A man 
    on a white horse...He is a man in search of a mission...Mr. Carter has a sense 
    of personal history...CARTER IS THE &quot;MAXIMUM LEADER&quot; TYPE...all 
    he needs is a crisis.'&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mr. Carter, (however), is 
    in absolute conflict with those who brought him to power. Mr. Carter believes 
    (so he says) in a Supreme God. The basic belief of the Trilateral Commission, 
    the National Council of Churches, and the nation's political and economic 
    leaders is not in a Supreme God, but in man, and in man's ability to solve 
    his problems on his own...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will this contentious situation 
    endure...One may wonder if there will be a power confrontation between Mr. 
    Carter and those who brought him to power, or if Mr. Carter remains in the 
    Trilateral camp...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a chance that Mr. Carter 
    may not be consciously aware of his conflict. He was technically trained and 
    educated. His tendency is to function mechanically. He is not a philosopher, 
    by training or inclination, as are not most military or business men who 'work 
    with cold hard facts.' Carter is susceptible. With no well thought out philosophical 
    base, such a man is easily influenced by any whim or idea that comes along...Therefore, 
    regardless of how Mr. Carter is viewed--a man knowingly or unknowingly in 
    conflict with those who brought him to power, a man who compromised himself 
    and what he believes in, a man who really does not know what he believes--he 
    is captain of a Ship of State apparently about to enter a storm. One finds 
    great difficulty in exuding confidence that the journey will be completed 
    safely.&quot; Cycles of War, </font>pp.127-131<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><b>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There is no doubt, however, 
    that Jimmy Carter both in and out of office was more committed to arms control 
    than was Reagan and less inclined toward military intervention. When the streets 
    of Manhattan swelled with 80,000 demonstrators rallying against nuclear proliferation 
    on June 12, 1982, Carter added his voice to Coretta Scott King's clarion call 
    on the generals of war to turn their swords into ploughshares. It was a call 
    he could justifiably make, since Carter while president had used U.S. armed 
    forces only twice...while Reagan deployed military forces eighteen times and 
    often much more aggressively. In his 1993 book for young adults, 'Talking 
    Peace: A Vision for the Next Generation,' Carter lists all the Reagan military 
    initiatives in a chapter about the insanity of making war. If Armageddon was 
    really imminent, as Reagan warned on a number of occasions, CARTER WAS PREPARED

    <p align="center">DON'T BOMB, URGES CARTER</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>WASHINGTON__Former President Jimmy Carter yesterday said he is opposed to 
    bombing Iraq, fearing a military strike would be counterproductive and slaughter 
    innocent civilians.</p>
  <p>The White House shrugged off Carter's comments. &quot;We respect the guy,&quot; 
    a top Clinton aide said, &quot;but he's always opposed to force, and sometimes 
    there's no other option.</p>
  <p>In an interview on CBS' &quot;Up To The Minute&quot; news program, Carter 
    said airstrikes against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein &quot;might very well 
    cause the death of 100,000 or more totally innocent Iraqi people who are already 
    suffering under the dictator's oppression.&quot;</p>
  <p>Calling the use of force &quot;counterproductive,&quot; Carter added: &quot;I 
    think the bombing of Iraq would be the wrong step any time in the near future. 
    I think the best thing to do is to be firm, be patient, work with our allies 
    and friends, put constant pressure on Iraq to force Saddam Hussein to permit 
    UN inspections, but I think the basic and very difficult work is patience.&quot;</p>
  <p>Carrie Harmon, a Carter spokeswoman, said the former President had taken 
    the same position in a private meeting with Clinton in Washington last month, 
    WHEN HE ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT HE'D SUPPORT THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN THE CRUNCH. 
  </p>
  <p>"IF WE DO GO TO WAR," Harmon said, "he would certainly be supportive of President 
    Clinton and our troops. He is certainly aware that we only have one President 
    at a time."</p>

<p><font size="+1">And so goes the text of Jimmy Carter's <i>Talking Peace.</i> 
  It speaks profusely of America, and of Jimmy Carter's own fervent belief in 
  the sacred ideals of the American nation--a nation that was founded in bloodshed 
  and rebellion, in <i>manstealing</i> and <i>landstealing</i>, in genocide, and 
  in oppression and injustice, thus in gross violations of all the teachings of 
  Christ. In the name of Jesus, however, this<i> Teacher</i> (see it in the Dead 
  Sea Scrolls) does not even once suggest to the young people he is addressing 
  in this book, that they have a 2,000 year-old commandment--not only to come 
  out from among the nations of the world, <i>And be ye separate</i>, but to stand 
  bold in the day of judgment and refuse to serve in the armed forces of any of 
  these nations (which is nowhere near the point that Jimmy Carter is ultimately 
  and subtly making in his discourse), or to be under the command of <a href="GiveUntoCaesar.htm">any 
  world leader</a> other than Christ. </font><font size="+1">Nor does he mention 
  the provisions of the Federal Emergency Management Act that he strengthened 
  or helped enact into law with his approval of Executive Order 11921, which gives 
  the president and the federal government the uncontested power, as we just mentioned, 
  to suspend all the guarantees of free expression and assembly that he speaks 
  of here, in the event of some national crisis (such as an all-out state of war, 
  or perhaps the manifestation of the Messiah)?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a harsh assessment of NATO,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In sharp contrast to the 
    general public's perception, human rights champion Jimmy Carter was no pacifist. 
    It should not be forgotten that the only 20th century American president who 
    had a longer military career than Carter's...was Dwight D. Eisenhower. Carter 
    abhorred only the unnecessary use of military force (He is a proponent of 
    Augustine's pernicious &quot;Just War&quot; doctrine), and as president he 
    worked to modernize the armed forces not to weaken them. 'I'M A MILITARY MAN 
    BY TRAINING AND BACKGROUND, AND THE STATISTICS ARE THERE,',' he pointed out 
    years later to rebut Reagan's claim...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus as Reagan prepared to take 
    office, it was far easier for him--thanks to Carter--to rally a consensus 
    behind his strident policies for winning the cold war, Carter tried peaceful 
    coexistence with the Kremlin and had been betrayed. The stupidity of the Soviet 
    invasion of Afghanistan turned Carter into a hawk. As Journalist Martin Walker 
    later wrote, 'AMERICANS SHOULD RECALL THE STEEL BENEATH THE GENTLENESS; the 
    real historical legacy of Jimmy Carter is as one of the men who won the Cold 
    War. Yet it was the compassion of the human rights program that had freed 
    political prisoners across Latin America and the Soviet Union that Carter 
    wanted to be his lasting legacy--and that is what he set his mind to upon 
    leaving the White House.&quot; </font>The Unfinished Presidency, pp.21-23<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What the Carterites underestimated

    His positions were always clear: if it was a tax, he was against it; if it 
    was a new weapons system, he was for it. Carter, on the other hand, was always 
    mired in specifics, TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS AGAINST THE B-1 BOMBER BUT

    Haig, the hawkish former NATO commander, Nixon chief of staff, and NSC deputy 
    to Kissinger--by seconding Haig's view that it was necessary to deal toughly 
    with the Soviets...Yet Brzezinski still remained fiercely loyal to, and even 
    downright defensive of Carter, whom he considered A HAWK. The two men had, 
    after all, shared a vision of infusing American foreign policy with a new

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW JIMMY CARTER AND 
  I STARTED THE MUJAHIDEEN</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An interview with 
  Zbigniew Brzezinski, January 15-21, 1998</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: The former director of the CIA, 
    Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs (&quot;From the Shadows&quot;), that American 
    intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months 
    before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security 
    advisor to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is 
    that correct?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Yes. According to the 
    official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, 
    that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But 
    the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, 
    it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret 
    aid to opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote 
    a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this 
    aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Despite the risk, you were an 
    advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet 
    entry into war and looked to provoke it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: It isn't quite that. 
    We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability 
    that they would.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: When the Soviets justified their 
    intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement 
    of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, 
    there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Regret what? That secret 
    operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians 
    into the Afghan trap and you want me to forget it? The day that the Soviets 
    officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the 
    opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War. Indeed, for almost ten 
    years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict 
    that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet 
    empire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: And neither do you regret having 
    supported the Islamic [insurgence], having given arms and advice to future 
    terrorists?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: What is more important 
    to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? 
    Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of 
    the cold war?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Some stirred-up Moslems? But 
    it has been said and repeated: Islamic fundamentalism represents a world menace 
    today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Nonsense! It is said 
    that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There 
    isn't a global Islam. Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery 
    or emotion. It is the leading religion in the world with 1.5 billion followers. 
    But what is there in common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morroco, 
    Pakistan militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing 
    more than what unites the Christian countries. </font>Translated by Bill Blum,

    debated historical questions is whether President Truman made the right decision 
    in ordering the atomic bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima...The horrors of a 
    nuclear attack are being compared with what might have happened during weeks 
    of massive bombing with conventional forc, followed by the mainland invasion. 
    In 1984, I was the first senior American statesman to visit Hiroshima, and 
    I was deeply moved by the remaining evidence of destruction, and the estimates 
    of 66,000 deaths from the attack. Clearly this was a devastating military 
    blow with horrific human consequences. STILL, I BELIEVE THAT TRUMAN'S DECISION 
    TO USE THE BOMB WAS CORRECT. REMEMBER, WE WERE IN A DECLARED WAR, DEFENDING 
    DEMOCRACY, OUR NATION, AND OUR CITIZENS...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although most Japanes strongly 
    disagree, it seems to me, that THIS DIFFICULT DECISION HAD TWO OVERRIDING 
    BENEFITS. Much greater invasion casualties were avoided, and the terrible 
    evidence of atomic power has proved to be a major deterrent to its subsequent 
    use. THUS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VAST, ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE EVIL OF A WORLD 
    WAR, THE LESSER EVIL OF USING THE FIRST ATOMIC WEAPON MAY HAVE BENEFITED HUMANITY 
    IN THE LONG RUN--THOUGH AT AN AWFUL PRICE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE OF FAITH, I

    WAS TO PROTECT AMERICA'S INTERESTS while living peacefully with the Soviet 
    Union. IF PEACEKEEPING EFFORTS FAILED, AS HAPPENED BEFORE WORLD WARS I AND 
    II, I WAS PREPARED TO USE FORCE IF NECESSARY. In addition, the mutual know-ledge 
    of our of our mighty response capability was the greatest possible deterrence 
    to an enemy attack and the destructiveness of the alternative--A THIRD WORLD 
    WAR. THUS, ALTHOUGH THE LIFE-AND-DEATH POWER I HELD AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF
