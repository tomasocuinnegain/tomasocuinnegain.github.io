<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks 
    are all children, and there is no such thing as an old Greek. 'What do you 
    mean by that?' inquired Solon. 'You are all young in mind,' came the reply: 
    'you have no belief rooted in the old tradition, and no knowledge hoary with 
    age. And the reason is this. There have been and will be many different calamities 
    to destroy mankind, the greatest of them by fire and water, lesser ones by 
    countless other means. Your own story of how Phaethon, child of the sun, harnessed 
    his father's chariot, but was unable to guide it along his father's course 
    and so burnt up things on the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt, 
    is a mythical version of the truth that there is at long intervals a variation 
    in the course of heavenly and a consequent widespread destruction by fire 
    of things on the earth&#133;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our records tell how your city 
    checked a great power which arrogantly advanced from its base in the Atlantic 
    ocean to attack the cities of Europe and Asia. For in those days the Atlantic 
    was navigable. There was an island (a continent), opposite the strait which 
    you call (so you say) the Pillars of Hercules, an island larger than Libya 
    and Asia combined; from it travelers in those days could reach the other islands, 
    and from them the whole opposite continent which surrounds what can truly 
    be called the ocean. For the sea within the strait we are talking about is 
    like a lake with a narrow entrance; the outer ocean is the real ocean and 
    the land which entirely surrounds it is properly termed continent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this island of Atlantis had 
    risen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island, 
    and many other islands as well and parts of the continent; in addition it 
    controlled within the strait, Libya (Africa) up to the borders of Egypt and 
    Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This dynasty, gathering its whole power together, 
    attempted to enslave at a single stroke, your country and ours and all the 
    territory within the strait&#133; At a later time there was earthquakes and 
    floods of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night all 
    your fighting men were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis 
    was similarly swallowed up by the sea and vanished; this is why the sea in 
    that area is to this day impassable to navigation, which is hindered by mud 
    just below the surface, the remains of a sunken island.&quot; (see Job 41:30).

<p><font size="+1">When one studies all there is to study about the ancient Phoenicians 
  (including all that is not known about them, or that is purely speculative), 
  one will realize, first of all how these ancient mariners were plying their 
  sea-trade far out in the Atlantic in early times (long before they entered the 
  Mediterranean Sea), how their base of operations was ancient Britain and the 
  Webstern coasts of Europe and how the place-names we associate with these sea-farers 
  in the Mediterranean were carried with them from the West and relocated there. 
  And by studying the words of the prophets one will also begin to understand 
  how these Tyrenian-Phoenicians were the progenitors of all commercial wickedness 
  in the world--a wickedness that is now coming to its own powerful conclusion 
  in the earth. Nevertheless, the most adept among those ancient Phoenicians knew 
  the way to Eden and back, and assisted the prophets in the formulation of the 
  Hebrew mysteries--the mysteries of Light and the mysteries of Darkness. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Just as every soul is composed of both spirit and flesh--and 
  the one cannot live on earth without the other--so it says that Solomon made 
  a league between the children of Israel and the subjects of Hiram, king of Tyre, 
  charging them together to build a House for God (2 Chronicles 2). And as we 
  discover the historical and cosmological dimensions of this Temple--how they 
  extend from the furthest East to the Western ends of the earth, and into the 
  fulness of these times--and as we learn how to open the books of the Prophets 
  in their proper order--we will not only understand Britain and America's joint 
  role in these great epic affairs, but we will be able to see the spirit of this 
  Hiram appearing again, at precisely the right time in history, to fulfill and 
  complete these matters--these great hidden works of Darkness. (Open the books 
  of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries as these 
  mysteries began to return full-circle to their place of origin here at the Western 
  ends of the earth)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To understand the foregoing passage 
    we must know the symbology employed in the Bible. The masses of the ancients 
    regarded the Sun as a god, the more enlightened as a symbol of God. Gold, 
    because of its color, was the symbol of the Sun. Likewise brass, being more 
    plentiful and of a similar color, was often substituted for gold. In the process 
    of mental evolution the Sun, because of its position in the 'above,' assumed 
    an ethical aspect of the spiritual and likewise those materials which symbolized 
    the Sun. In this sense the Biblical statement that &quot;Hiram was filled 
    with Wisdom and Understanding, and cunning to work all works of brass' actually 
    informs us that he was cunning, or skilled, to 'work all works' spiritual. 
    Together with the other two we have the Spiritual, Psychical and Physical.

    of the objective mind which retires to the secret closet of its own innermost 
    being--withdrawing from the material world, there to 'draw designs upon the 
    trestle-board'--the receptive subjective mind, which but waits for the imprint 
    of those 'designs for living.' The 'craft' is Universal Mind which develops

  Beast. (And of course, the question will arise, where do we go when we come 
  out? And the answer to this will appear with events as they unfold. We will 
  meet at the Center). The initial motivation to come out of this system should 
  be spiritual, and rooted in our individual as well as collective sense of what 
  true righteousness and justice is, and, obversely, what the world looks like 
  in the absense of it. (It looks exactly like the world as it presently exists). 
  Our motives must ultimate be rooted in a firm belief in the teachings handed 
  down on the Mount (Matthew, chapters 5 to 7), and if we are Jews, in a proper 
  understanding of the words of the Prophets--thus not only in a corresponding 
  sense of God's Terrible Presence in the world, but in a thorough understanding 
  of the direct relationship that exists in the earth between injustice, war, 
  and the present ruling capitalistic (Zionist) order. (The entire Bible, from 
  Genesis to Revelation, is a prophetic indictment of the entire religious, economic, 
  political and military order that has come to power in the Western world in 
  these last days). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the Word became flesh and dwells among us (and that means, 
  <i>in</i> <i>us</i>), so the whole mystery of God's righteousness eventually 
  comes right down to <i>economics</i>--and not only with the way that each and 
  every person relates materially to every other person in the world, but in the 
  way that all of us together relate to the Earth itself, our Mother, and all 
  of Her resources. It is in the great interest of all these things that God has 
  brought the world to its impending economic crisis, not only to bring the very 
  necessary judgments upon the present world-order (for all of its historical 
  injustices, and so that it will be clearly apparent to every future generation 
  what God will never tolerate again), but also to bring us out of captivity, 
  to deliver us out of a system from which we cannot otherwise deliver ourselves.

    Bush talks about ending terrorism. I thought that is what Afghanistan was

    you can fool some of the people all of the time. Bush talks about the weapons 
    of mass destruction. Well, the US is the all-time world leader in this field. 
    We nuked the Japs. We used Agent Orange and other herbicides in Viet Nam. 
    Agent Orange was both a biological and chemical killer. Every shell used gunpowder 
    or a substitute for its propulsion. That is the use of chemistry as an agent

    score but he also would not stand up for his beliefs. Every other Congressman 
    and Senator should have stood up for Moran but they knew what had happened 
    to James Trafficant and were afraid. The Bible talks about the 'fear of the 
    jews' five times. Some things never appear to change. The bottom line is that 
    when the US fights for the Jews, we loose all sense of morality and decency 
    and forfeit any right to call ourselves Christian. </font>Sincerely yours,

  the one with the other). It is the ability to distinguish what is spiritual 
  from its literal and material framework that sets the children of Light apart 
  from the children of Darkness; but it is not merely the ability to perceive 
  spiritual reality that sets them apart, but to be guided by the precepts of 
  that reality. In other words, it is of little value to merely know that another 
  dimension to reality, or to the sacred Scriptures, exists (as the Masonic Order 
  does), unless we allow ourselves to be ruled by the higher precepts of that 
  reality (as the Masonic Order does not). It is of little value to know that 
  the Temple is spiritual (as most Christians profess) if one continues to kill 
  and oppress others within the walls of this Temple, in violation of the precepts 
  layed down by the God who resides in this Temple. Or if one assists in the establishment 
  of a new nation, and new laws, which supplant and overturn the ordinances of 
  that people--Israel--whose Temple it is (as the American nation did when it 
  came to power in the 18th century...Deut.4:1-24); or if one, contrary to the 
  Law, sets up a throne in the midst of the Temple, as the American nation also 
  did when it made George Washington and all the subsequent sons of Darkness to 
  sit upon it one after another. </font></p>

  would have this Power unto itself. It has witnessed what it began to believe 
  was the downfall of its only real rival, Soviet Communism, and has been trying 
  ever since to extend its own doctrines and philosophies in that direction, to 
  seal the victory. The Western world is already feeling the consequences of this 
  (futile) attempt. (Joel 3:9-14). And if God would yield to them there are certain 
  religious figures in America, who would breath the Holy Spirit right into the 
  Body-politic of the American Corporate-state. (1 Corinth.14:6-9; Ezek.16:17, 
  33). God, of course, has no intention of yielding, as both the Scriptures and 
  coming world events will clearly testify. The entire American experience has 
  come to pass so that when the future merchants of Tyre come calling to these 
  shores they will say of the economic order that men have labored under in this 
  age: <i>This is (indeed) Ca-bul forever. </i>(1 Kings 9:13; Rev.18:10-19). </font></p>

  the Vineyard of Na'both by force (1 Kings 21), thus bringing the mind of Israel 
  to the English Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the whole dilemma of Jewish Zionism

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON. As President Clinton 
    crams for his trip to China this week, he must be yearning for those simpler 
    days, not so long ago, when it was much easier to explain to Americans the 
    distinction between friends and foe in Asia.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the first Clinton Presidential 
    campaign the Chinese Government was the menace, run by dictators &quot;coddled&quot; 
    by President Bush as they oppressed Tibet, threatened Taiwan, forced abortions 
    and swiped American technology. Then there was Japan, America's biggest military 
    ally and partner in Asia. Sure, the Japanese kept out American car parts and 
    computer chips, barriers that Mr. Clinton vowed to smash. But whenever trade 
    quarrels got really nasty, cooler heads in Washington would remind people 
    that it was Japan--market oriented and host to American troops--that Washington 
    can count on in times of crisis.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But no one could imagine the kind 
    of crisis Asia faces in today's economic meltdown. And if you listen closely 
    to the oratory of Washington before the most important foreign trip of Bill 
    Clinton's Presidency, things sound very different. On Tuesday Treasury Secretary 
    Robert Rubin took to the podium of the White House to declare that &quot;China 
    has been an island of stability in Asia&quot;--a savvy, responsible player 
    in the global effort to tramp down the economic firestorm that started in 
    Asia a year ago.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Japan? The view from Washington 
    these days is that it is spreading the bubonic plague of the markets--wild 
    instability--while refusing to take the cure. When Mr. Rubin went to the Oval 
    Office Monday night to tell Mr. Clinton that the United States had to reverse 
    policy, spending billions in the currency markets to prop up the yen, he described 
    it as desperation effort to save Japan from itself. Inside the Treasury, his

  <b>SAVING THE DOLLAR FROM DESTRUCTION</b></p>
<p align="center">by Hans F. Sennholz</p>
<p align="center">[Posted October 29, 2003]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Never before in recent history have monetary and fiscal policies been 
    as &quot;stimulative&quot; as today, and yet, the American economy remains 
    weak and vulnerable. The Federal budget deficit for the 2003 fiscal year was 
    posted at $555 billion, some six percent of GNP; it may continue to rise in 
    coming years when new tax reductions add their weight. </b></p>
  <p><b>The Federal Reserve System has opened its flood gates and reduced all 
    interest rates to their lowest levels since the 1950s. Its basic rate now 
    stands at just one percent, permitting the stock of money in all its forms 
    to soar at frightening rates. Government and Federal Reserve officials are 
    convinced that this combination of stimuli is bound to facilitate an annual 
    growth rate of 3.75 to 4.75 percent, just like that of the late 1990s. The 
    fact that this opinion is widely held by many officials and economists is 
    no evidence that it is accurate; indeed, in our age of inflation and economic 
    manipulation, an official pronouncement is more likely to be political than 
    sensible. With the gates wide open, the rush of liquidity is bound to inflict 
    serious harm not only on the American economy but also on global conditions. 
    The Federal Reserve's utter disregard of the market rate of interest, which 
    guides the efficient employment of all factors of production according to 
    consumer choices, is bound to do great harm to the economic structure. It 
    causes severe maladjustments and imbalances which market forces sooner or 
    later are bound to correct.</b></p>
  <p><b>Record-low interest rates encourage present consumption and generate massive 
    debt. In just five years, total financial as well as nonfinancial American 
    debt has surged by 51 percent or $10.9 trillion to more than $32 trillion, 
    three times the annual Gross National Product. The Federal government itself 
    is chafing under a $6.8 trillion debt and adding $1.6 billion a day. At present 
    interest rates, this debt alone commands charges of $300 billion a year, or 
    more than $1,000 per man, woman, and child. It may be no concern for officials 
    and politicians who, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, reassure us that internal 
    debt merely is a debt by the nation to the nation and interest payments just 
    are payments to ourselves. But it frightens this observer. It may soon distress 
    millions of households which, tempted by low mortgage rates, converted their 
    housing equities into consumer goods and new debt. During the last quarter 
    alone American households added $397.6 billion in mortgage debt and another 
    $40 billion in credit card debt. The annualized rate amounts to more than 
    $1.5 trillion or approximately fifteen percent of GNP. If it is true that 
    the living standard of Americans has been stagnant for years, we must draw 
    the startling conclusion that this boost in debt was needed to maintain it. 
    If the rate of new indebtedness should ever decline, or the people should 
    choose to repay some debt, living standards would surely plummet.</b></p>
  <p><b>Facing the mountain of debt, even President Roosevelt would be frightened 
    today as nearly one-half of the U.S. Treasury debt is held by foreigners. 
    The Bank of Japan alone owns $440 billion of Treasury securities, the Bank 
    of China some $122 billion. Other Asian governments hold $166 billion. They 
    have become major creditors because U.S. trade deficits, which are a direct 
    consequence of the super stimulation, now exceed $500 billion a year. Yet, 
    U.S. dollars do not readily plunge in foreign exchange markets, as other currencies 
    would, because they are special, they are the primary reserve currency of 
    the world. Central and commercial banks and millions of individuals all over 
    the world hold and use them; some central banks eagerly purchase them in order 
    to assist their own export industries. In Keynesian fashion, they promote 
    employment by weakening their own currencies.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;A small debt makes a man your debtor, a large debt makes him your 
    enemy.&quot; If this old saw holds true also for governments, the U.S. government 
    must have countless enemies and be making more every day. Foreigners are financing 
    the American purchase of goods and services, half a trillion dollars worth 
    every year, which visibly sustain American standards of living. Foreigners 
    are investing in U.S. Treasury obligations and dollar assets, trusting in 
    the continuing integrity of the U.S. dollar. But with the stock of dollars 
    rising incessantly and American debt soaring at disturbing rates, their trust 
    is wearing thinner every day. By now, they may be considering the following 
    scenarios.</b></p>
  <p><b>No central bank on earth, not even the Federal Reserve System, can continually 
    inflate its currency and defy market rates of interest without harming both 
    its currency and the economy. Inflation tends to accelerate and ultimately 
    destroy the currency and cripple the economy. And no government whatsoever 
    can suffer budget deficits of half a trillion dollars annually without impairing 
    its standing with its creditors. Piling debt on debt undermines their trust 
    and raises the crucial question of debt resolution.</b></p>
  <p><b>Important foreign creditors nevertheless may choose to stay the course 
    in the hope that their debtor will bring his house into order. They may continue 
    to peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, as the government of China has 
    been doing with persistence, and to enjoy the influx of dollars. It not only 
    has given employment to millions of Chinese workers producing goods and services 
    for the American market but also attracted much American capital and technology, 
    enabling them to leap from 19th century economic conditions to contemporary 
    high-tech capability and productivity. They obviously will not make haste 
    to increase the value of their currencies, which would depress their sales 
    and curb the flow of American capital. They may even be prepared to bear the 
    costs of a sudden devaluation of their large dollar holdings, if the U.S. 
    dollar should finally fall under the growing weight of foreign indebtedness.</b></p>
  <p><b>Other foreign creditors who are dismayed by the soaring trade and budget 
    deficits of their giant debtor may quietly reduce their holdings of U.S. Treasury 
    obligations. The recent fall of the U.S. dollar from some 120 yen to just 
    108 may signal a change in Japanese attitude and policy. At the same time, 
    the American dollar fell more than ten percent toward the euro. The European 
    Central Bank may not have reduced its dollar holdings, but many European investors 
    and traders undoubtedly did. They may be frightened by the soaring American 
    deficits or merely seek higher interest returns in European capital markets. 
    Growing foreign reluctance to continue to cover American trade deficits and 
    help finance U.S. Treasury deficits is bound to affect American financial 
    markets and economic activity. All interest rates must rise although the Federal 
    Reserve may want to offset foreign reluctance with its own willingness to 
    support Treasury obligations. But such Fed reaction may alarm many foreign 
    creditors who may react by liquidating more U.S. Treasury obligations; it 
    surely would trigger a financial crash and launch a worldwide recession. Fear 
    is the driving force of all crashes.</b></p>
  <p><b>Both U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials seem to underrate the 
    growing international dangers to both the dollar and the economy. But even 
    if they were cognizant of the true situation, their choices of action would 
    be rather limited...</b></p>
  <p><b>The pessimists in our midst envision a truly calamitous chain of events. 
    They are convinced that present policies will continue year after year until 
    inflation accelerates and finally destroys the dollar, as it has so many other 
    currencies in the past. Federal spending is scheduled to head ever higher 
    not only to meet existing military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan but 
    also to expand Medicare, the Federal healthcare program for the elderly. Both 
    political parties are eager to include prescription drugs, which are estimated 
    to cost $400 billion over the next decade. The real bill, of course, would 
    be much higher. Pessimists brace for ever greater instability and prepare 
    for another Great Depression with declining world trade and commerce and falling 
    standards of living around the globe. These augurs now portend political consequences 
    that may follow the economic upheaval....</b></p>
  <p><b>This economist cannot envision the total destruction of the American dollar, 
    the primary world currency... Once again the Fed may succeed in stabilizing 
    a smaller dollar....A more optimistic scenario would be a gradual abandonment 
    of the monetary policies and an orderly readjustment to unhampered market 
    conditions. The Federal government would balance its budget in the next few 
    years by holding the line on both transfer spending and military outlays. 
    The Federal Reserve System would allow the market rate of interest to resume 
    its basic function, the efficient allocation of economic resources in the 
    course of time. A painful readjustment process would commence immediately; 
    interest rates would rise, calling a halt to misguided spending patterns and 
    encouraging saving and capital formation. Boom industries soon would suffer 
    withdrawal symptoms while others would revive from several years of stagnation. 
    At the same time, China and other creditor countries hopefully would allow 
    their currencies to rise and the U.S. dollar to decline gradually, which would 
    trim America's trade deficits, raise goods prices, and depreciate all dollar 
    debt at home and abroad. With the Federal budget in balance and interest rates 
    at market levels, the dollar would continue to function smoothly as the primary 
    world currency.</b></p>
  <p><b>Many Asians are convinced that they experienced the currency crisis as 
    a result of the international U.S. dollar policy. The dollar system exports 
    massive inflation, instability, and unsustainable debt around the world, and 
    the oil-producing countries of Asia exchange strategically important and diminishing 
    assets for paper dollars. It is hardly surprising that the subject of their 
    increasing concern is the role of gold in international trade and financial 
    exchanges. </b></p>

  out of the traditions of the prophets to Mandane, the mother of our more familiar 
  Cyrus at the time of his birth. The oracles, as did the Hebrew scriptures, connected 
  the events of those times with the great events that were prophesied to come 
  to pass at the end of this age--when the Lord of Light would rise up everywhere 
  in the world to overthrow the reign of Darkness and deliver the elect. The prophets, 
  or magi, said that these mysteries were embodied in the name of the great deliverer, 
  Cyrus (a name somewhat as noted then, as Moses, David and Jesus are now), and 
  thus the child-king was so named:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Astyages had a daughter, 
    whom he named Mandane: concerning whom he had a dream that ENOUGH WATER FLOWED 
    FROM HER TO FILL HIS CITY AND OVERFLOW ALL ASIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He imparted his vision to those 
    of the Magi who interpreted dreams, and when he heard what they told him he 
    was horrified; and presently, Mandane now of marriageable age, he feared the 
    vision too much to give her to any Median...but wedded her to a Persian called 
    Cambyses, a man whom he knew to be well-born and of a quiet temper: for Astyages 
    held Cambyses to be much lower than a Mede of middle estate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in the first year of Mandane's 
    marriage to Cambyses, Astyages saw a second vision. He dreamed that there 
    grew from his daughter A VINE WHICH COVERED THE WHOLE OF ASIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having seen this vision, and imparted 
    it to the interpreters of dreams...(they) told him that the child would rule 
    in his place.&quot; </font>Herodotus, Book I.107-08<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shinto is a sacred rope wrapped 
    around a huge Tree or mossy Stone, little shrines scattered seemingly at random 
    throughout both city and country landscapes, festivals that can be solemn 
    and raucous simultaneously--yet these are only the more readily accessible 
    characteristics of a tradition considered to be &quot;ethereal&quot; and &quot;inscrutable&quot; 
    because it does not act in the way religions usually do. What we today call 
    Shinto has been at the heart of Japanese culture for almost as long as there 
    has been a political entity distinguishing itself as Japan, or Nihon, &quot;Land 
    of the Sun Source.&quot; Through fourteen centuries of recorded history this 
    mixture of rituals, institutions, magical practices, charms, and so forth 
    continues to participate in the framing of Japan both to the outside world 
    and to the Japanese themselves. From &quot;structural impediments&quot; affecting 
    the ongoing trade imbalance with the United States, to Japanese sensitivity 
    about international criticism of its economic policies, to the outlay of public 
    funds at the death of one emperor and the enthronement of his son--Shinto-based 
    orientations and values, like some great aquifer, lie at the core of Japanese 
    culture, society, and character, nourishing and furthering the lives of both 
    individuals and institutions in subtle, yet often quite tangible, ways.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the twentieth century comes 
    to a close, it is increasingly difficult to find societies like Japan where 
    cosmologies from the past are still thought immediately relevant to present-day 
    activities of modern men and women. Where but in Japan will a corporation 
    begin construction of a state-of-the-art laser refraction laboratory with 
    an ancient ritual to calm the spirit of the earth? Where else can we find 
    so many individuals who feel a need to take their brand new Honda or Toyota 
    to a shrine to have it blessed before subjecting it to the vicissitudes of 
    highway driving? From the new emperor in his Tokyo palace down to the poorest 
    farmer...Shinto cosmologies have been like the glass of a window through which 
    the phenomenal world and human existence have been viewed for over two thousand 
    years. Yet, due to a lack of charismatic teachers and intellectually stimulating 
    theological texts, of which Shinto has very few, those in the West who have 
    made an effort to understand Japan and its people have never really grasped 
    Shinto's influence upon social, cultural, and especially, political norms.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The (high priest) is absent today, 
    summoned by the Central Association of Shinto Shrines to lead a tour group 
    to China, and so, in his stead, Senior Priest Oka will read the (Invocational 
    prayer) and Takeshita-san will plunge his hand into the cauldron. Most rituals 
    follow the same basic steps: the Kami (the spirit being invoked) must be summoned, 
    the food offerings must be placed on the altar, and the sacred words must 
    be intoned in the right mind and spirit...As the music begins from within 
    the shrine, one of the two (young female dancers) faces east, the other west, 
    with the mighty boiling cauldron set between them. </font>(Please understand 
    the imagery at Ezekiel 11:4-11; Ezek.24:1-14)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their dance this time is not composed 
    of the slow dreamy circles they weave before the altar in most rituals; the 
    music dictates a faster pace requiring more powerful movement. They bow and 
    spin, rotating around the cauldron, then proceed to each of the Four Corners 
    of the enclosure, their arms always straight in front, the wands they hold 
    serving as powerful charms against the multitude of evils and impurities thought 
    to be lurking in the Four Corners of the world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though the dancers are favorites 
    of the Kami for their grace and beauty, they can only begin the war this festival 
    wages against evil. Like their Shugendo predecessors during the Tokugawa period, 
    they must join forces with a priest before the Cauldron ritual achieves its 
    full expression...With a Sword in his outstretched hands, he follows the route 
    around the Fire that the dancers established. The Sword is up, ready for use. 
    His first circle completed, he bows with the Sword held in both hands, head 
    lower than the blade (which faces the cauldron), then positions the weapon 
    and slashes twice into the steam. After bowing again, he moves to the next 
    position on the route, until, after Four bows and Eight forays into the steam 
    and Four bows and Eight cuts in the Four directions (north, south, east, west), 
    he returns to the starting position and briefly drops to one knee as a gesture 
    of humility and closure before going back to the shrine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interpretation of what is happening 
    here depends on the informant: each slash of the Sword is a partial severing 
    of the hold evil can have on people and places; it is also a penetration into 
    the fabric of impurity which hangs like a curtain between ourselves and our 
    &quot;divine&quot; possibilities, obscuring a life closer to the way of the 
    Kami. We encountered earlier the power of water as a cleansing agent in Shinto 
    practice and it is to this climax the ritual has been advancing. Takeshita-san, 
    who tells me later it had been two years since he last performed this role, 
    uneasily takes his place facing the Cauldron and the West. Behind him stands 
    one of the dancers with a six-foot-long bamboo pole adorned with paper streamers. 
    The raucous drum and cymbals that accompanied the Sword flashing are silent 
    now, poised for the moment the priest proves that he is sufficiently pure 
    to scatter the sacred water, boiling hot, into the atmosphere (with his bare 
    hand), where it will magically disperse and further purify the world...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It all comes to a close with the 
    final, solo bow of the acting high priest before the Central altar. Everyone 
    joins in, renewed and reassured that, not only has the world been transformed 
    from a profane into a sacred and purified sphere, but they themselves, due 
    to the efforts of the priests and dancers on their behalf, have been cleansed 
    and, in a sense, reborn. With their bamboo sprigs proudly in hand and the 
    ceremonial sip of sake still sweet on their lips, a trusting, almost childlike 
    innocence can be perceived on the people's faces as they descend the shrine 
    steps and are absorbed by the city below. </font>A Year in the Life of a Shinto

    between transcendental unity and immanent diversity. In a word 'Kokutai' proves

    flareups of trade friction between the United States and Japan, a prominent 
    critic was complaining to a member of the Diet about the Japanese attitude 
    toward international relations. The critic contended that even as Japan claims 
    it is misunderstood, it does not try to make itself understood. The dietman 
    smiled ironically, 'That,' he said, 'is Japanese.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps everyone has heard of the 
    mysterious East or the inscrutable Orient. It may be assumed that the Japanese 
    are inscrutable, for example, because Oriental cultures are inherently difficult 
    for outsiders to understand. Less frequently suspected (however), is the deliberate 
    and later subconscious use of bafflement and mystification, as a part of the 
    ancient art of war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All sorts of Western attempts to 
    take advantage of Japanese resources, from their economic power to their Zen 
    Buddhism, have been thwarted or distorted by bafflement and mystification...The 
    impression of mystery may appear to veil a secret, but the main secret may 
    turn out to be that mystery itself is a weapon, an art of war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The veil of mystery is just one 
    of the arts of war that permeate Japanese political, cultural, and social 
    life. For those trying to understand the Japanese mind and civilization--and 
    that may include anyone involved in the modern world--there is no practical 
    way to overlook the military rule and martial culture that have dominated 
    Japan for so many centuries, virtually up to the present day. So steeped in 
    the way of the warrior has Japanese civilization been that some of the manners 
    and mentality of this outlook remain embedded in the deepest strata of the 
    individual and collective unconscious of that nation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sword is one of the three basic 
    symbols of Shinto, the ancient Japanese religion, AND SO OF THE IMPERIAL HERITAGE, 
    which emerged after centuries of racial and tribal wars in ancient Japan. 
    The Sword became the soul of the Samurai, who gradually extended their control 
    from the frontiers and provinces to become the dominant power in Japan for 
    nearly eight hundred years.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even in the social and cultural 
    spheres, Japan today still retains indelible impressions of the samurai Bushido, 
    the Way of the Warrior. This is true not only in education and the fine arts, 
    but also in...attitudes and conduct marking the course of political, professional, 
    and personal relations. Well-known attributes such as the reserve and the 
    mystery of formal Japanese behavior, as well as the humility and hauteur, 
    are deeply rooted in the ancient strategies of the traditional art of war. 
    To understand Japan and the Japanese in depth, therefore, it is essential 
    to understand the culture of strategy crafted by the Japanese art of war.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoroastrianism, although the smallest 
    of the major religions of the world in the number of its adherents, is historically 
    one of the most important. Its roots are in the proto-Indo-European spirituality 
    that also produced the religions of India. It was the first of the world's 
    religions to be founded by an inspired prophetic teacher. It was influential 
    on Mahayana Buddhism and especially on the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, 
    Christianity, and Islam. To the latter three, Zoroastrianism bequeathed such 
    concepts as a cosmic struggle between right and wrong, the primacy of ethical 
    choice in human life, monotheism, A CELESTIAL HIERARCHY OF SPIRITUAL BEINGS--ANGELS 
    AND ARCHANGELS THAT MEDIATE BETWEEN GOD AND HUMANITY </font>(see 1 Corinthians 
    15:40,41)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, a judgment for each individual 
    after death, the coming of a Messiah at the end of this creation, and an apocalypse 
    culminating in the final triumph of God at the end of the historical cycle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoroaster was a Persian prophet 
    on whose teachings the ancient religion of Zorastrianism is based. The name 
    by which he is commonly known in the West is from the Greek form of his original 
    name, Zarathustra, which means &quot;Shining Light.&quot; (A Star). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholars differ considerably about 
    the date of Zoroaster's birth. Greek sources place Zoroaster at 6000 years 
    before the death of Plato, about 6350 B.C. Archaeological remains in Turfan, 
    China, state that Zoraster was born &quot;2715 years after the Great Storm,&quot; 
    placing his birth at 1767 B.C. The latest dates for his life come from Persian 
    writings that place him 258 years before Alexander, that is, about 600 years 
    B.C. Many other scholars place Zoroaster's birth between 1500 and 1200 B.C....</font></p>

    teachers, called the Sons of the Fire. From this great teacher came down a 
    line of prophets, who superintended the early development of the Iranian peoples 
    and all of whom bore the name of Zoroaster. The Zoroaster the Greeks refer

    from Asia MInor in the west to India in the east and from Armenia in the north 
    to Egypt in the south. Cyrus showed great respect for the nations he had conquered.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ahura Mazda is depicted in the 
    Zoroastrian scriptures as a kind of Trinity: &quot;Praise be to thee, Ahura 
    Mazda, threefold before other creations.&quot; From Ahura Mazda came a duality: 
    the twin spirits of Spenta Mainyu ((the Holy or Bountiful Spirit) and Angra 
    Mainyu (the Destructive or Opposing Spirit). The twin spirits are popularly 
    though of as good and evil, but rather they are two principles that represent 
    all the opposites of life. In her lecture on &quot;Zoroastrianism,&quot; Annie 
    Besant has this to say of them: Good and evil may be said to only come into 
    existence when man in his evolution develops the power of knowledge and of 
    choice; the original duality is not good and evil, but is of spirit and matter, 
    of reality and non-reality, OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS, of construction and destruction, 
    the two poles between which the universe is woven and without which no universe 
    can be...There are two names again that give us a clue to the secret, the 
    &quot;increaser&quot; and the &quot;destroyer,&quot; the one from whom the 
    life is ever pouring forth, and the other the material side which belongs 
    to form, and which is ever breaking up in order that life may go on into higher 
    expression.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the trinity of Ahura Mazda 
    and the twin-spirits that emanated from him is a Sevenfold expression of the 
    divine reality. These Seven are called the Amesha Spentas or Holy or Bountiful 
    Immortals, the Highest Intelligences. They are sometimes thought of as archangels 
    and sometimes as aspects of Ahura Mazda himself...</font></p>

  <p>Pray that China's bubble won't burst <br>
    Thomas L. Friedman NYT <br>
    Monday, May 03, 2004</p>
  <p> TOKYO Here's what I learned in Tokyo: If you're the leader of Japan, America, 
    Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines 
    or the European Union and you're not going to bed each night saying the following 
    prayer for China, then you're not paying attention:</p>
  <p>&quot;Dear Heavenly Father, please keep the leader of China, President Hu 
    Jintao, healthy and on an even keel. Please see to it that he moves steadily 
    and carefully toward restructuring the Chinese banking system and ridding 
    it of its huge overhang of bad loans and corruption, before there is a real 
    meltdown that would be felt around the world.</p>
  <p>Give him the wisdom to cool the overheated Chinese economy without creating 
    a recession that would prompt China to stop importing like crazy and start 
    just exporting like crazy. And Father, forgive us for all the bad words we 
    used in recent years to describe China's leaders - terms like 'Butchers of 
    Beijing.' We did not mean it. We meant to say 'Bankers of Beijing,' because 
    their economy is now fueling growth all over Asia, bolstering Japan and sucking 
    up imports from everywhere. May China's leaders live to 120, and may they 
    enjoy 9 percent GDP growth every year of their lives. Thank you, Father.</p>
  <p>Amen.&quot;</p>
  <p>The most striking thing about being in Asia today is hearing how much more 
    important China's growth engine has become for companies all across the region 
    - and well beyond it. When Chinese authorities told banks last week to cut 
    back their wild lending, commodity prices and stock markets tumbled all over 
    the world. News that China is having regular blackouts because it can't buy 
    enough crude oil is helping push up gasoline prices the world over.</p>
  <p>While three years ago the Bush team came to office growling about no longer 
    coddling China - the way those &quot;wimpy&quot; Clintonites did - that talk 
    has disappeared from the Bush vocabulary. It's not just business as usual 
    now. It's business only.</p>
  <p>To some degree the world is getting hooked on China - its cheap labor, its 
    voracious appetite for commodities and capital (over $50 billion in foreign 
    direct investment last year) and its emerging middle class. The more hooked 
    we become, the less the world can tolerate any sort of prolonged instability 
    there. If the China bubble bursts, it will be the mother of all burst bubbles. 
    Which is why we need to pray that China's leaders will have the skill to cool 
    things down, just enough but not too much, without some wheels falling off.</p>
  <p>&quot;A lot of the world's stability or instability is resting on the leadership 
    in Beijing - there is no question about that,&quot; argues Richard Koo, chief 
    economist for Nomura Research Institute. But, he insists, &quot;Chinese leaders 
    understand what world they are living in. They have a general equilibrium 
    view of the world - that what they do affects us all and then comes back to 
    affect them.&quot;</p>
  <p>That seems true. But one of the ways that China has grown so rapidly in the 
    last decade has been by decentralizing authority to regions and letting governors 
    or mayors attract whatever investment they can. It is not clear anymore how 
    much the center can slow things down.</p>
  <p>And considering the huge amounts of foreign investment that have flowed into 
    China in such a short time, &quot;it's very hard to think that they could 
    have invested that much money efficiently,&quot; remarked Robert Feldman, 
    managing director in Tokyo for Morgan Stanley. &quot;So the senior leadership 
    is scared, because if they have a hard landing from bad loans you have a regime 
    problem. (But) when they tried to slow the economy, they got real push back 
    from the regions, who said, 'You in Beijing have all that infrastructure. 
    Why shouldn't we have a new bridge or road?'&quot;</p>
  <p>Given how opaque China's decision-making is, it's hard to predict how Chinese 
    leaders will balance their obligation to behave in a way that promotes global 
    equilibrium with their need to create millions of jobs each year in order 
    to stay in power.</p>
  <p>One can only say three things: 1. They've done a pretty good job so far. 
    2. The job gets harder every day. 3. No one will be immune to the fallout. 
    The relationship of the world to China right now reminds me of that old banker's 
    rule: If a client owes you $1,000, that's his problem. If a client owes you 
    $1 million, that's your problem. China's stability is our problem.</p>
