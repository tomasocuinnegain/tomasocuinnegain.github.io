<p><font size="+1">Dear Rabbi Weiss,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I pray that you will take the time to give this letter your 
  serious consideration, particularly in light of the things (these age-ending 
  events), that are presently unfolding in the Middle East. I saw several members 
  of the Neturei Karta in Washington D.C. at the April 20th gathering in support 
  of the Palestinian cause. I wanted to speak to them but they seemed to be in 
  a hurry to get somewhere. Perhaps you were among them. The verses came to mind...</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">He that keepeth the Fig Tree shall eat the fruit thereof, 
    and he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured...</font></i><font size="+1">(Proverbs 
    27:18)</font><b>.</b></p>

<p><font size="+1">...and from the Christian perspective, others that said: </font></p>

    for he saith the old is better...</i>(Luke 5:39)<i>. </i></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Please don't let all these past centuries of division and 
  animosity between Judaism and Christianity govern your reactions here. (There 
  is very little time left for such divisions). Christianity has only distant, 
  and scattered recollections of the (purely kabbalistic) meanings of its own 
  sacred writings (its own <i>midrashim</i>). The key to understanding them (in 
  part), ironically passed over to the Lunar side of the Mystery (to the Jewish 
  side of the Oracle), with all of those other Kabbalistic doctrines that were 
  secretly sewn into the Judaic mainstream after the birth of Christianity by 
  those Jewish Essenes in the first centuries of this common era. </font><font size="+1">And 
  Judaism, in turn, was not going to interpret these oracles in favor of Christianity 
  (at least not that form of Christianity that forced itself upon the world from 
  the third century on), nor could it. Normative Judaism as we have come to know 
  it, was charged in those times with building a fence or a hedge around the Written 
  Torah, and those who were charged with building it were also instructed to get 
  inside that fence themselves. They were instructed to stay inside until ordered 
  to come out in the Day of the Lord. And as such the deed was accomplished. G-d 
  had wrapped up the entire mystery--<i>As the words of a book that is sealed</i>--and 
  kept it from the eyes of the whole world...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Woe if I shall reveal it! Woe if I shall not reveal it</i>, 
  lamented Reb Schimeon in the pages of the <i>Zohar</i>. The implications of 
  it all shall now shake the foundations of Judaism as well as Christianity. It 
  was kept from both.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Of course you know the story of Jonah. When the preacher is 
  finally let out on dry land, lo and behold he finds himself here at the Western 
  ends of the earth, and at the end of the age...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> (There are other dimensions to reality and there are higher 
  worlds, as you well know, than the ones we can observe and experience with our 
  physical senses). Jonah finds everyone in this world (this lowest world), going 
  about their own political, economic and religious affairs, and participating 
  in all the turmoil of the times, completely bewildered and completely unmindful 
  of the prophetic signs and spiritual realities that are unfolding everywhere 
  around them. Like the Torah itself, this world and these realities are like 
  a great historical puzzle, whose every single piece must be fit back together 
  in order to get a clear picture of the whole. Of course he is not alone in his 
  perceptions or in this work. Thousands of others are being awakened to the same 
  realities and are working on the same puzzle. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As you recall the story in <i>The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer</i>, 
  Jonah has seen the Red Sea, through which the children of Israel have passed. 
  He has also encountered the Behemoth and the Leviathan. And now he is back in 
  Nineveh, the great city. We are also told that he descended to <i>Sheol</i>. 
  Believe me, <i>Sheol </i>and Nineveh are the same place. How is it written?</font></p>

  events--the final judgment wars of this age--have already been ignited and are

<p><font size="+1">That evening in Washington I stayed with a friend at the house 
  of Harvey and Lorraine Arden. Harvey wrote that wonderful National Geographic 
  article on the Satmar Hasidim, back before the passing of the Rebbe Yoel Teitelbaum 
  in 1979. That article, along with growing up right next to the Williamsburg 
  section of Brooklyn, has had a direct effect on this work, and on all the images 
  running around in my thoughts since then--the work and the images that I hope 
  you will make an earnest effort to consider (which, of course, you will be compelled 
  to in the end. I pray that it will be sooner than later).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I would like you to consider the visage of the Leviathan. Please, 
  do not have an intellectual reaction. Open your spiritual eyes and see it. You 
  know full well that all of the prophets spoke of the day when this great creature 
  would emerge from the sea--when it would rise up out of the consciousness of 
  the planet onto the plain of human consciousness. That day has already come. 
  Please see how the continent of Europe is the head of this Dragon, and how its 
  immense jaws are wide open toward the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is the tongue 
  protruding from the Dragon's opened mouth. Scandanavia and Asia-minor are its 
  right and left limbs. And of course all of Asia is the body of this great creature, 
  whose powerful tail has already shaken three times over the course of the wars 
  of the 20th century... </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Once you have resigned yourself to the reality of the Dragon's 
  existence all the other pieces of the world-mystery begin to fit neatly into 
  place. Among those pieces is the realization that the City of David (the focus 
  of all religious contemplation in the Western world--the focus of the Crusades 
  of the middle ages, and the focus of the Zionist movement in the 20th century), 
  is not, nor has it ever been situated in the land of Palestine as the Western 
  world has been led to believe, but it has always been hidden right there in 
  the center of Europe under the present-day city of Vienna, Austria.</font></p>

  all these centuries. It is also the historical reality those Merkabah mystics 
  (those Essenes and Pharisees, as well as Gentile believers, who layed the foundation 
  of the Christian mysteries) concealed from the world at the beginning of this 
  common era. They were bound by pact and association to keep it secret, so that 
  all the elements of Darkness would reveal themselves in the last days (in both

    often in Serpent form, was replaced by a Father figure who was distinctly

    to live in. One type of caveman who inhabited the Neanderthal Valley, had

  Mystical Jordan), which in those ancient times led up out of the East into Europe;

    is the body; all those who identify themselves with the body are the ignorant, 
    the Egyptians. To come forth out of Egypt is (ultimately) to leave the body; 
    and to pass through the Red Sea is to cross over the ocean of generation, 
    the animal and sensual nature, which is hidden within the blood. Yet even 
    then they are not safe; crossing the Red Sea they enter the Desert </font>(the

    is with the children of Israel throughout all their journeys in the wilderness)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    now begins to shepherd the flocks of Jethro. </font>(Jethro, the priest of 
    MID-ian is a composite figure of the ancient Druid order, whose central mysteries 
    not only informed the mind of Israel but which were identical with it)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The 
    flocks which represent the thoughts and commands of the bad shepherd have 
    to be put in order by Moses, led into justice. His relation to Jethro is indeed 
    like Jacob's to Laban, but is much better a type of the way the Good Shepherd 
    will come in and shepherd our flock. The allegory is an extended one of the 
    divine power of salvation, and the divine care God exercises for those who 
    come to Him...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With his vision thus clarified, 
    and with the practical assistance of Aaron, Moses now goes to Egypt to begin 
    his great work. He returns to Pharaoh to struggle with him and ultimately 
    destroy him. Pharaoh represents all that is bad in human nature, a lover of 
    pleasure who knows not God. He is one who rejects both parents </font>(not 
    his earthly parents, but his Heavenly Father and Divine Mother...Proverbs 
    6:20)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, divine and human restraint, 
    and hence, with Egypt his country, represents the body in its worst form.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Captive in this country is the 
    mind 'fond of seeing,' Israel, which at this stage is rather the mind 'capable 
    of seeing.' This mind must be led out of Egypt if it is to get the vision, 
    and it is Moses, who with Aaron, has the power to do this for man's higher 
    nature. The salvation he brings the Israelites is one 'where the helping principle 
    of its own accord comes wholly from the outside to shield us after our faculties 
    have been quite destroyed.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the people are thus united in 
    one great collective act of migration they are made one; from being a multitude, 
    or a tribe, or a people, they become an 'ecclesia,' a church, united not so 
    much in body as in mind, intent, and spirit. The Passover is held at Evening 
    because of the usual significance of evening, the time of the fading of material 
    light at the coming of immaterial illumination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In another passage Pharaoh is king 
    of the lower bodily mind in revolt against God. Not only is the mind engrossed 
    in the complicated structure of pleasure, but it takes the higher mind with 
    its possibilities of Vision and enslaves it. The higher mind groans heavily 
    at this subjection and cries to God the only Saviour. In answer God commands, 
    'Send forth the people that they may serve me.' The type of service to which 
    He calls them is not a menial one; it consists of going up to the aetherial 
    heights with their reasonings, setting them before Moses, the type of existence 
    beloved of God, to lead them on their way.&quot; </font>By Light, Light, The

  epic dimensions or the deepest meanings of the Torah itself. (<i>Levi shall 
  instruct Judah</i>). You are not yet aware of the relationship that exists between 
  Judaism and Christianity (the Moon and the Sun--Judah and Levi), and therefore 
  of the ways that Christianity is coming to its conclusions in our time with 
  the manifestation of the antichrists here at these Western ends of the earth 
  (2 Thessalonians 2...KJV). You are--blessedly but--naively unaware of the spiritual 
  relationship (the Dark-symmetry) that exists between the Bush administration 
  in the West and the present government in <i>Israel </i>in the east. Both are 
  Zionist states, both are attempting to <i>build up Zion with iniquity, and Jerusalem 
  with blood</i>. And whereas the state of Israel cannot speak on behalf of the 
  Jewish people, neither does Rome (in the past), nor America (in the present) 
  represent the teachings of Christ in the world:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">September

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DEAR HONORABLE PRESIDENT 
  GEORGE W. BUSH</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are writing to you because of 
    your deep and abiding interest in the suffering of the peoples of the Middle 
    East and your desire to finally bring an end to all the bloodshed and violence 
    there. We pray for peace and brotherhood.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, we would like to respectfully 
    bring to your attention that although you are aware that there are many Jews 
    who support the State of Israel, what you may not have heard about is that 
    there is a silent majority of Jews opposed to Zionism who remain ignored by 
    the media, and who remain steadfast in loyalty to the teachings of our rabbis 
    that the ideology of Zionism is in utter opposition to our religion. For more 
    information there are a number of websites on the Internet that discuss this 
    subject, e.g. www.jewsagainstzionism.com. which we know you will find most 
    interesting as it includes historical documents and photographs related to 
    the longtime opposition of revered rabbis to Zionism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ever since the destruction of the 
    holy temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish people some two thousand 
    years ago, we have been enjoined to be scrupulously loyal to the countries 
    we reside in, and never seek to undertake to establish independent sovereignty 
    in the Holy Land or anywhere else throughout the world. One of the great biblical 
    prophets, Jeremiah, in chapter 29 of his book proclaimed G-d's message to 
    all the exiled; verse seven reads: </font><i>Seek out the welfare of the city 
    to which I have exiled you and pray for it to the Almighty, for through its 
    welfare you will have welfare</i>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    has been a cornerstone of Jewish morality throughout our history to this very 
    day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zionist movement rejects all 
    the fundamental principles of our Torah and rabbis. Jews do not need a state 
    of their own. The very establishment of a &quot;Jewish&quot; state is a grave 
    violation of Jewish tradition and law. Therefore they do not represent the 
    Jewish people in any way whatsoever. They have no right to speak in the name 
    of the Jewish people. Therefore their words, declarations and actions are 
    not in any way representative of the Jewish people. We deplore acts and policies 
    carried out by those who -- misusing the name of Israel -- have substituted 
    the ideal of nationalism for the teachings of the Holy Torah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, Mr. President, it is 
    of the utmost urgency that the State of Israel should not be referred to as 
    a Jewish State, but as the Zionist State. The FOUNDATION of its existence 
    is not Judaism, but the Zionist ideology. We are extremely concerned that 
    referring to it as a &quot;Jewish&quot; state endangers the welfare of Jews 
    worldwide by linking Jews and Judaism to the actions of the Zionist state. 
    The Zionist state with its supporters worldwide seeks to take all measures 
    possible, including provoking hatred of Jews through Israeli policies, in 
    order to convince Jews to move from their native countries to the State of 
    Israel!! Indeed, hatred of Jews is the very lifeblood and oxygen of the Zionist 
    movement and their state, which stand in total opposition to Judaism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout history when persecution 
    resulted in expulsions, there were always other nations who opened their doors 
    to the Jews, and were blessed by G-d for doing so. We believe that our country 
    would even welcome those Jews who wish to leave the State of Israel, and bring 
    great blessing onto the United States.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your good intentions and kind consideration 
    in relation to Jews is greatly appreciated, but we strongly believe that G-d's 
    blessings upon the United States will grow if there is greater understanding 
    and different policies in relation to this issue of the difference between 
    Judaism. and Zionism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We await the days when all the 
    world will recognize the sovereignty of the Creator, and the words of the 
    prophet Isaiah will yet be fulfilled: </font><i>And they shall beat their 
    swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font><i>No nation will lift its sword against any other, nor will they learn 
    warfare any more</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. We remain, 
    yours very truly, </font><i><font size="+1">The Silent Majority American Jewry</font></i></p>
