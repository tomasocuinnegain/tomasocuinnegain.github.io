  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Dear Arthur Hawkins, </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Thank you for reaching out to say hello that 
    day in Huntington. You were selling African-American products and religious 
    articles, and I, just obviously looking and passing by. (I bought a button 
    that said Teach the Children the Truth). You greeted me anyway, in the caring 
    manner that is evident in all the children of true faith. That faith, and 
    our mutual concern for the things of God, took its own natural course. Our 
    conversation began to consider the nature of the times we live in, as well 
    as the state of the races, and how each is trying to make sense of the times 
    from their own historical perspectives--especially in light of the just-passed 
    Martin Luther King Day observances. We both observed that, in your community 
    in Pennsylvania and in our's here in West Virginia, very few people attended. 
    I overheard one black woman in a carryout store say: &quot;And what, march 
    through town with the police?&quot; I understood what she meant. All the civic 
    participants who come out to be noticed on these occasions--the mayor, police 
    and fire chiefs, schools officials, business and industrial leaders (like 
    American corporations showing up for Earth Day ceremonies), and the police 
    escorts themselves (and some of them may have even come out with a good heart), 
    have had the effect of assimilating these movements, rendering them virtually 
    meaningless. The effects are particularly devastating when viewed in the light 
    of those words which say: <i>Come out from among them my people</i>. (The 
    picture will become clearer now, and brought into perspective, in light of 
    the newly established Office of Homeland Security, the Patriot Act and the 
    TIPS program, and the realization that the underlying Fascist spirit in America--the 
    violent military and police state that it has always been--is finally surfacing. 
    It is revealing itself in reaction to the judgments that God is now bringing 
    upon the American nation). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">I had promised myself that if I was ever interviewed 
    by a newspaper or TV journalist, I would simply refuse to talk to them, or 
    respond: &quot;Look, if I say something profound or meaningful you will not 
    report it. If I say something acceptable to the common ear, or even foolish, 
    you will report it. Or you will edit it to make it sound like I said what 
    you wanted it to sound like I said.&quot; What I did say to the reporter instead--against 
    my own judgment--in reply to a question about the presence of several grandchildren 
    I had brought to the &quot;march,&quot; was that I brought them in an ongoing 
    attempt to increase their level of social and spiritual awareness. Such an 
    awareness of the issues of social justice, or the lack of it, is a necessary 
    step toward the attainment of spiritual awareness. &quot;Without the one,&quot; 
    I told the reporter, &quot;the other would prove misguided, hollow, and self-serving.&quot; 
    (This particular newspaper appeals to a religiously conservative readership). 
    And then: &quot;That the Civil Rights Movement as we know it is over.&quot; 
    It touched as many hearts and minds as it could. Save for the young and still-impressionable 
    (whose interests are not political but those of youth itself), its effects 
    are complete, and that the reality of Darkness has set back in. I told him 
    that the same was true for the antiwar movement, and for the entire spiritual 
    thrust of the fifties, sixties, and seventies in this country. Not, however, 
    because these were meaningless times, or because these events and these movements 
    failed to bring about their intended effects. On the contrary, the effects 
    were achieved, and we are now ready to move on to the next stage of events, 
    and to the next state of understanding. (The ruling conservative mind does 
    not believe that the counter-cultural movement in America was a wholly spiritual 
    one, and cannot imagine how it was the preparatory work of the Spirit of God 
    who cares for, and who dwells among Their people, and who are creating a people 
    in Their very own &quot;radical&quot; image. Real Love is a radical thing; 
    it is a daring thing, it is also a patient thing. God is Love, expansive Love, 
    not reactionary politics or conservative economics. God has no contract with 
    the American political order)...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">Be patient therefore brethren, unto the 
      coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits 
      of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early 
      and the latter rain.</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="center"><i><font size="+1">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: 
  for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh...</font></i><font size="+1">(James 
  5:7,8).</font></div>

  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1"> On the contrary, because a great number of 
    souls were, and are still truly being &quot;born again&quot; in these events. 
    They are coming out of the confusions, the illusions and the obvious failures 
    of the political process, and are following the spirit of these times to a 
    state of deeper, inner reflection instead. They are awakening. Everyone (even 
    our strident socialist brothers and sisters who still somehow imagine that 
    they can change the world without Divine intervention, along with this present 
    generation--Generation X--which hasn't made up its mind about things yet), 
    is waiting for the next event, or events. Everyone, whether they understand 
    it or not, is waiting for the descent once again of God's Holy Spirit, just 
    as it is written: <i>And when the day of Pentecost were FULLY come</i>, (Acts 
    2:1-21). It is all leading to a real national revival, and we are not referring 
    to the &quot;American&quot; nation. We mean the true Spiritual nation that 
    is presently captive here to the American state of mind. We are talking about 
    &quot;coming out of Egypt again.&quot; (See Genesis 15: 13,14 and Exodus 1:8-10). 
    Did the reporter mention any of this? Of course not.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">We look into the world, and into what appears 
    to be an insoluble state of social chaos and division (please understand Jeremiah 
    4:23). Even those who are destined to inherit the age-to-come seem to be divided 
    along all of their various social, religious as well as racial fault-lines. 
    We realize, of course, that nothing short of the next manifestation of Christ 
    could break the impasse between us, or halt the downward spiral into the great 
    Darkness that the rest of the Western world has fallen into. We also realize 
    that the people can not, or will not, be gathered together into any Messianic 
    notion which does not in turn encompass at least something of their own world-view. 
    They will not be gathered to any idea that falls short of the universal implications 
    of the words: <i>Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in 
    all, </i>(Ephesians 1:23), and: <i>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of 
    the Godhead bodily. </i>(Colossians 2:9). Our understanding of the coming 
    of Christ must reconcile those things which are invisible and above, with 
    those things that are visible and below--Heaven and Earth. And they must definetly 
    include the mysteries of the African continent:</font></p>

    is like a baobab tree; one person's arms cannot embrace it" (African proverb)</font></font> 
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Protagonists 
      of religious traditions which lay exclusive claim to divine revelation have 
      tended to regard Africa as a blankly barren land, waiting to be planted 
      and watered with the heavenly seeds of truth which are found in their particular 
      religious traditions. This assumption fuelled the Christian missionary enterprise 
      in the past two centuries and continues, unabated, to this day. And although 
      the agents of the missionary enterprise have changed, the assumption persists, 
      albeit in modified form, in the evangelistic work of the fundamentalist 
      groups, some indigenous African churches, as well as the mission-founded 
      churches. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The 
      zeal to evangelize left no room to accommodate local religion-cultural traditions 
      which were deemed to be palpably wrong and had to be done away with. And 
      to drive home the point that truth and error could not coexist, cultic symbols, 
      shrines and sacred groves were destroyed.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The close identification 
      of the Gospel with the self-image of its propagators led to the unquestioning 
      conviction that God had clearly and decisively acted in their history, and 
      that they were under divine obligation to bring others, in whose history 
      God had apparently not acted, into the arena of this salvation history. 
      And the fundamental questions as to whether God acts in other people's histories 
      and what those histories tell us about God, as well as whether history is 
      the only arena of God's self-disclosure, remained unasked and unanswered.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The relationship 
      between the Gospel and local traditions was considered to be that of total 
      discontinuity, which tended to severely and fastidiously limit God's revelatory 
      activity to one event. But to recognize continuity between the Gospel and 
      other traditions is to accept the fact that in no human history has God 
      been absent; and that God could not be dormant in one historical place or 
      period and active in another.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">It may be that 
      in their passionate eagerness to emphasize the centrality of Jesus and the 
      newness of Christianity, theologians inadvertently created a dichotomy in 
      God's truth and claimed the right to evaluate God's revelatory acts in the 
      histories of other people. </font> </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Such hardened 
      positions led to the strenuous efforts at converting others and ignored 
      the possibility of human error in the appropriation of divine revelation 
      or truth. Human understanding was invested with a degree of absoluteness 
      which is out of step with our finiteness; and it was almost as if the arms 
      of Christianity alone could completely embrace the baobab tree of divine 
      truth, and that God's thoughts had to coincide with human thoughts.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The existence 
      of a plurality of religions is not to be interpreted as a failure on the 
      part of those who have the truth to carry out their divine mission to bring 
      all humankind into the fold. Nor does this point to the hardness of the 
      hearts of other people. On the contrary, it expresses the spirit of God 
      which blows "where it listeth". And to insist on the same response to the 
      experience of God's spirit is to argue for a uniformity which refuses to 
      respect differences.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Above all, claims 
      to truth must be related to the lives of those who claim monopoly over it. 
      For if the truth is to be rescued from the realm of theory and propaganda, 
      then is must be reflected in the lives of those who lay claim to it. For 
      religious traditions should help humankind to attain and maintain the highest 
      human values - values which make us more human and are fundamental to our 
      ultimate good, and which uphold harmony and order among the community of 
      nations in the world and in our societies.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">There is need 
      to go beyond the acceptance of religious plurality to a stage where each 
      religious tradition will bear witness to its faith by doing worthy deeds, 
      and express rivalry, not in contentious disputations about who is right 
      and who is wrong, but by striving to undo each other in improving the lot 
      of humankind, in enhancing the quality of human life and in doing what is 
      good. And if we can compare the improvement in the lot of humanity to building 
      a house, then the meaning of the African proverb which says: "Let the elephant 
      fell the trees, let the bushpig dig the holes, let the mason wasp fill in 
      the walls, let the giraffe put up the roof, then we will have a house", 
      will become clear. </font> </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">If we recognize 
      that the arms of our particular religious traditions cannot fully embrace 
      the baobab tree of truth, it will engender an attitude of respect for others 
      and rescue us from a position of assumed superiority and righteousness which 
      entitles us to declare, in advance, what God will do in the present and 
      at the end of time. </font> </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">My own researches 
      and reflections over the past three decades in Africa, have led me to an 
      openness which I believe will rid us of the tendency to disrespect others 
      because their beliefs are inferior to ours. And in any case, how can people 
      be saved if they are being despised? Or is this the price to pay for salvation, 
      whatever we mean by it?</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">I 
    have also been forced to rethink our efforts to force God to be what we "know" 
    God to be, without allowing God to manifest God's self in multifarious ways. 
    It has become clear to me that our inability to live with differences or pluralism 
    is a measure of our limited knowledge (arms too short to embrace the totality 
    of the baobab tree of truth), rather than an incomparable divine command to 
    impose uniformity in belief and expression on all humanity.<b> </b></font><font color="#000000">Kofi

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Others, in turn, will not be gathered into any 
    idea of Christ that fails to comprehend and reconcile the most outer and inner 
    (highest and deepest) concepts of 20th century physics. Others will not be 
    gathered into any idea of Christ that does not fathom the deepest recesses 
    of the human psyche, or explain human behavior in terms of the divine pattern 
    of creation itself. They will not be reconciled to any form of the Mystery 
    of Christ that cannot also locate the <i>subterranean</i> passageways that 
    connect East and West; that is, that cannot reconcile Taoist, Shinto, Hindu, 
    and Buddhist thought in the East to Judaic, Christian, and Islamic, and let 
    us not fail to mention pre-Columbian American thought, in the West. Nor can 
    we be gathered to any notion of Christ that cannot connect, as we have already 
    mentioned, the mysteries of the South to those of the North, showing how the 
    traditions that prevail in every human direction, North, South, East and West, 
    are all mirror reflections of the other, and how together, each form the structure 
    of one greater Divine Reality. There is only ONE God. Look around and see 
    exactly what <i>They</i> look like. (Only the most egotistical minds refuse 
    to slay that part of themselves that deny that reality). Thus neither can 
    we expect the mind coming to perfection in our time to be reconciled to any 
    notion of Christ (Messiah) that does not perfectly reconcile the male and 
    female principles of creation to each other again--and not with all the subtle 
    world-play and manipulation of terms that we are used to from literalists 
    and others in traditional (male) positions of authority, but in reality. (Those 
    in such positions of authority are ignorant of the world-mystery system that 
    gave birth to Christianity, and prove it by having allowed themselves to be 
    placed in such positions, especially in such a time as this, wherein it is 
    God's intention to bring down the institutions of this age and replace them 
    with righteous government and Their own anointed ones--The great world-church 
    for instance: it has never understood the story Adam and Eve, much less the 
    story of Samson, an ancient Herculean figure of the Christ-mystery on the 
    Tree of Life, <i>Who destroyed more in his death than he did in his life</i>)<i>.</i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Those who walk in the Spirit of the One God 
    are already one with each other, no matter where they meet on earth. They 
    are one with the fact that all of the sacred stories and all of the Holy Scriptures 
    of humankind blend into one another in a great historical way, and thus with 
    the realization that they must all be read in the same epic and archetypical 
    sense as the other. None is more exemplary of this than <i>The West African 
    Epic of Son-Jara</i>, which tells in its own revealing way the otherwise hidden 
    story of the Bible. The poetic saga relates the story of the Universal Hebrew 
    Children, how it found its way southward (clearly in this story through the 
    mind of Islam), and across the sub-Saharan plains of Africa, finding a resting 
    place in the cultural traditions of the people of Mali before it took mid-passage 
    centuries later to where it finds its completion at the root of the World 
    Tree here in America. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Each story of this kind has an exoteric or outer 
    dimension that produces one effect upon the mind of the reader, depending 
    upon the locality, historic orientation or spiritual disposition of one's 
    thoughts, and an esoteric or inner dimension that produces another. The outer 
    produces conflict and division, the inner (after it has produced its own form 
    of spiritual division), creates unity. It is the outer, literal aspects of 
    Holy Writ that are bolstering the Western (as well as Jewish and Islamic) 
    religious, political and military structures of our times--and which are also 
    bringing each of them to their own timely conclusions. And this is exactly 
    the intent of the oracular nature of these sacred writings--to separate the 
    Light from the Darkness in the fulness of time. It is the inner meanings that 
    liberate us from these structures, and releases us into the (so far) hidden 
    spiritual order of things. It is these inner aspects of Holy Writ--living 
    narratives having every literary device (similitude's and allegories, metaphors 
    and parables) for a soul, and every heroic and archetypal figure (every god 
    and goddess of the ancient world) for a body--that unite us with the idea 
    of the Presence of God--the ONE who inhabits the sum of all spiritual and 
    material reality. They also cause us to understand how difficult it will be 
    to entice the various religions, denominations and sects (the worldy ones), 
    to come together as one, short of national or economic calamity or finally 
    by the terrors of war itself. People are hardly ever moved by the spoken word, 
    but always by lightning and fire. (Hebrews 12:25-29). Of course, the key to 
    reconciliation still lies in an interpretation of history, and of the Scriptures, 
    that everyone can ultimately agree upon. Such an interpretation, even though 
    it has alluded us up to now, nevertheless exists as it is written: <i>Call 
    unto me and I will answer, I will shew unto thee great and mighty things which 
    ye knew not. </i>(Jeremiah 33:3).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">We spoke briefly of a discipline of study called 
    Kabbalah (a Hebrew word referring to the oral, or secret tradition that was 
    <i>received</i> by the children of Israel at the Foot of the mountain in the 
    time of Moses--a tradition that calls back to the time of the long-fabled 
    Adam in the Book of Genesis. This secret tradition has accompanied the literal 
    tradition--the Written Torah--across the times and is, in preparation of the 
    manifestation of Christ and the restoration of the kingdom of God on earth, 
    reviving itself in our time...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The first 
      question which the non-Kabbalistic reader will probably ask are: What is

      teachings? And why is a translation (or stu dy of it in general) required 
      at the present time?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will answer the 
      last question first. At the present time a powerful wave of occult (spiritual) 
      thought is spreading through society; thinking individuals are beginning 
      to awaken to the fact that 'there are more things in heaven and earth than 
      are dreamed of in their philosophy;' and last but not least, it is now felt 
      that the Bible, which has been probably more misconstrued than any other 
      book ever written, contains numerous obscure and mysterious passages which 
      are utterly unintelligible without some key to unlock their meanings. That 
      key is given in the Kabbalah.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">We did not get a chance to discuss how the Kabbalah 
    (which is generally considered to be a purely Judaic expression of what is 
    a much wider field of historical and religious studies), is, in its essence, 
    a study of the dimensions of the Tree of Life. We have followed this discipline 
    and found the ways in which the structure of this World Tree is able to direct 
    our thoughts, not only from one end of history to the other but from one end 
    of the earth to the other. The idea of the Sacred Tree is extremely ancient 
    and has filled the world with itself. By studying its history we can also 
    see why we conclude that those who carried this idea (these ideas) from one 
    ancient land to another were also sojourners from the West. These earliest 
    adepts in the Atlantean-Hebrew-European-Assyrian-Chaldean-Druidic-Brahman 
    (as well as Egyptian) mysteries--the <i>Asvins</i> as they were known in the 
    Vedas (or the <i>Maruts, </i>or Essenes, as they took their rise again in 
    the time of Christ)--appeared in the earth in the time of Adam (or <i>Manu)</i>. 
    They brought their evolving perceptions of the mystery of God's Presence (of 
    all Reality suspended on the limbs of the Universal Tree), out of the garden 
    of Eden with them:</font></p>

      collection of more than a thousand hymns composed in northwest India about 
      1500 BC, in an archaic form of Sanskrit, and ancient Indo-European language. 
      In addition to this canon numerous myths appear...composed a few centuries 
      later, known as the Brahmanas. These texts were not committed to writing 
      for many centuries, but were preserved as oral traditions. Later Hindu religious 
      literature draws heavily upon their characters and events.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central myth 
      in the Rg Veda is the myth of creation. This is described in several different 
      ways. Often the universe is said to have come in to being out of chaos <font size="2">(see 
      Genesis 1:2)</font>, when a God--Indra, king of the gods...or Vishnu, a 
      solar deity--separated heaven and earth. <font size="2">(See Genesis 10:25)</font>. 
      Then the Sun arose and from that spot, the Navel of the Earth, a Great Pillar 
      was erected to prop apart heaven and earth. The Pillar is the axis of the 
      world.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The point we have been making throughout this work is that 
    the Indo-European and S(h)emitic mysteries were originally one and the same, 
    or rather that the latter emerged within the spiritual context of that culture 
    which was spread in those ancient times from North America, across the Atlantic 
    and across Europe, as far as India in the east, and as far as Egypt and and 
    the present-day Ethiopia in the south. And that the Root of this Universal 
    World Tree--this whole system of thought--is embedded here in the Western 
    ends of the earth where the great Wheel of Genesis completes itself at last. 
    It completes itself in the minds of all who have made the spiritual pilgrimage 
    to the end of things here in the West (and thus to the beginning and the newness 
    of things as well), and who are able to look back into the East and perceive 
    the Divine Presence risen up everywhere in the world, in all of the events 
    and in all of the other peoples of the world. As great Light is born out of 
    great Darkness, and as Order is born of Chaos, all of human history has been 
    a preparation for the great Day of Deliverance. It completes itself in the 
    minds of all who are able to view the American-experience-in-particular<i> 
    </i>in light of the words: <i>Know therefore every Tree by its fruits</i>, 
    and those that say: <i>To those who overcome will I give to eat of the Tree 
    of Life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God</i>. (Rev.2:7). This 
    is the same Tree, and the same events that Paul saw when his mind was caught

  <p><font size="+1">All of this brings us to the point of this letter. If one 
    were to spend any time at all, say, on the streets of <a href="../UsedImages/pg800.gif">New 
    York City</a> (&quot;The Millennium Capitol of the World&quot;--modern Babylon, 
    modern Jerusalem), trading theological and historical points of view, they 
    would soon encounter that strident view which holds Africa to be the source 
    and the center of this entire epic (and among some, African people alone to 
    be God's chosen people--with a cursory admission to indigenous Americans, 
    certain Asians and other Third-World peoples). In a letter to Kadijah Ali 
    I expressed how most of this view would be perfectly acceptable--if only it 
    were true that is. I am no champion of the Caucasian race, or of the idea 
    of race itself, for what difference does it make in the end if one culture 
    or another was the original bearer of this Wisdom to the rest of the world, 
    if it all leads to the realization of the One God, to the highest levels of 
    <i>Dharma</i> (for union with the Divine is the singular purpose of man's 
    existence on earth), and to the realization of the fact that all of us together 
    are the children of this One Divine Reality? But this particular world-view, 
    held by many in the Afro-centrist movement, also carries with it the belief 
    that the &quot;white&quot; man is not only <i>not</i> among <i>the chosen</i>, 
    but is irrevocably and irredeemably lost--the child of the devil every single 
    one. We are almost tempted to agree with this assertion as well, but we know 
    from our own spiritual struggles, our own social experiences, our own resistance 
    to the religious and political structures of the Western world, and our own 
    conversation with God, that this is not true at all. We also know, because 
    of the great lessons we have learned as a result of the Black experience in 
    America--without which we would, indeed, still be irredeemably lost in the 
    American mindset of the forties and fifties--that we are, all of us together, 
    the children of the One Living God. <i>The length, the breadth, the depth, 
    and the height of it are equal</i>. </font></p>
  </div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">We also sense, in the light of present spiritual reality, 
    that those who have had both the fortune and the misfortune of being born 
    into Caucasian bodies in this lifetime have three active courses open to them. 
    (These, of course, reflect the choices that those of every other racial and 
    religious group must make, each in light of their own social circumstances 
    and experiences): </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(1) A continued state of spiritual arrogance, rebellion and 
    pride (the continued exercise of political and military and economic control 
    over the earth and its resources--at the ongoing expense of all &quot;lesser&quot; 
    peoples, as well as at the ongoing expense [rape is the word] of the planetary 
    environment in which all of the peoples of the earth must dwell). This is 
    the mainline Western thinking, and most Americans are on it. The consequences 
    of such a course are tragic for those who continue on it. It would be as totally 
    tragic for all the rest of the peoples of the earth as well, and for the sacred 
    environment all of us must share throughout all future times, if it was not 
    God's intention to rise up now in all the powers of the earth, to intervene. 
    These things are in fact happening, just as they were written. It will be 
    evident as God's Spirit continues to overwhelm the events of our time, overthrowing 
    at last the rule of those who are presently and ignorantly in charge of it. 
    (God had to allow these sons of Darkness the time to come to their fullest 
    measure). To follow this course, and to follow those who take it, is to participate 
    in the fullest sense with all the social and religious complexities that attend 
    the idea of <i> the Beast</i> in the Book of Revelation. (But isn't the whole 
    world guilty of beastliness? Quite so, and even moreso at times. But the issue 
    will ultimately be settled in America, because here in America evil is being 
    accomplished in the name of Christ. This nation should not have taken this 
    name, or this spirit to itself if it did not plan on walking in those precepts). 
    </font></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">(2) Joining the Reaction...which is the state of mental and 
    spiritual schizophrenia affecting literalists, Arayan nationalists, and other 
    American patriots who have been attempting to define themselves in both Constitutional 
    and biblical terms at the same time (please read Deuteronomy 4:4-34), and 
    who also see the present &quot;new-world-order&quot; as a threat to their 
    sovereign and <i>God-given</i> American way of life. It is the mindset of 
    all who cannot see into the greater spiritual structure of present world events, 
    much less the Scriptures that attend them, and who define themselves as a 
    result in purely nationalistic terms. They believe in the bible AND in the 
    myths of the American nation, and are always trying to preserve and fortify 
    the weak and mostly selfish little theological structures they have built 
    around themselves, and around their ideas, as if each were manning Truth's 
    last outposts...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Ironically enough these espouse the free enterprise ideals 
    of the globalists and internationalists, but for clearly different reasons. 
    For them, <i>IF Christ has set you free, you are free indeed.</i> It is more 
    Ayn Rand than Jimmy Carter. They uphold as a sacred responsibility the &quot;right 
    to bear arms,&quot; because it is in the Constitution, and the means by which 
    their Holy Zionist Nation was founded. One man I am acquainted with just purchased 
    20,000 rounds of ammunition to defend himself, his family (against his wife's 
    will) and his small outpost of land, from the government who he has been convinced 
    is out to turn every true patriot's domain into a flaming Waco. This may seem 
    true in light of the government's own present state of mind (well maybe not 
    the present Bush administration's state of mind), but in the end it is a case 
    of the American government trying to enforce what it perceives to be it's 
    sacred mandate from all the people to uphold the rule of law on behalf of 
    all the people. The patriots are stuck in the past, the government is trying 
    to carry it all into the future, but both are propounders of the same American 
    myth. The government, of course, can not realize how the entire American nation 
    is one large Waco Compound in the eyes of God who is about to judge it according 
    to the words: <i>With what judgment it metes, so shall it be measured unto 
    it</i>. (Matthew 7:1-5). The ones who will ultimately threaten the government, 
    however, and who will ultimately be rounded up in the time of national crisis--in 
    the &quot;tribulation&quot; as some call it--are those who will refuse to 
    bear arms of any sort at all, not in defense of the country, nor even in defense 
    of themselves. These are the ones who have clearly heard the message of Christ 
    which says: <i>Those who seek to save their lives shall lose it, and those 
    who lose their lives shall save it unto life eternal</i>. These are those 
    who will <i>stand bold in the day of judgment</i>, and who, through their 
    own personal sacrifice, will bring about the birth of the true holy nation 
    in the earth. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(3) The third course is Atonement. The entire world drama 
    is leading to another birth (a rebirth) of the Holy Nation, another deliverance 
    from Egypt--the lower state of mind. (Please connect Revelation 15:3 and Exodus 
    15). The people's sojourn in America (from 1585, the first European landing 
    on the shores of what would become the United States of America--or even from 
    1606 and the Jamestown settlement in Virginia--until the present), is a direct 
    reflection of Israel's sojourn and captivity in that Egypt in the East, in 
    ancient times, and is the fulfillment of the words:</font></p>

    the mysteries of Egypt and Ethiopia, and across the African continent till 
    She came to Mid-Passage with Her other children, and to the same fulfillment

  to Love to Endurance--and layed it down on top of this world-line and said that 
  everything on or below this line, including that city of Jerusalem made of stones

  that it is those things that lie above, including all of the things that have 
  come to pass in the 20th century, that are the focus and the fulfillment of 
  the Law and the Prophets. In doing so we discovered how that Egypt in the East,

  <p><font size="+1">In a work entitled <i>The African Origin of Civilization, 
    Myth or Reality</i>, by Chiekh Anta Diop, another entitled <i>Ethiopia and 
    the Missing Link in African History</i>, by the Rev. Sterling M. Means, and 
    in another late 19th century work entitled <i>Book of Beginning</i>, by Gerald 
    Massey, a convincing case is made for the theory, and for others the firm 
    belief, that the African continent is the source of the entire Western mythos, 
    thus the base upon which the entire philosophical and technological development 
    of the Western world stands. Do we, or rather, did we shrink from the possibility? 
    Does it, or rather did it create a racial (or cultural) reaction in us as 
    we studied these things, even ever so slight? Yes, the same as those who hold 
    to the African Theory will feel when they are confronted with this Circle 
    of History and American Genesis idea. But it is only our natural selves reacting, 
    not our spiritual selves. In the world above there are no racial differences, 
    and neither is there any separate pigmentations in the heart. Nevertheless, 
    while the divisions of race are an illusion to be overcome here on earth, 
    historical truth is essential to the further development of the whole Human 
    Race.</font></p>

<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Actually we would rush to the African-Eden Theory along with 
    so many others, if it was not for the almost completely obscure, rather fundamentalist, 
    but nonetheless compelling work of E.E. Callaway. In a book entitled <i>In 
    The Beginning</i>, he was almost certainly the first in our times to set forth 
    the idea that this work advances, concerning the whereabouts of Eden (locating 
    it, as he did, in the southeastern corner of the United States). (Please see 
    Chapter 2 and the subchapter in the Addendum entitled The Lower Garden and 
    the Tree of Life). By direct implication this places the whereabouts of the 
    original land of Ethiopia in America as well. (<a href="../UsedImages/pg2mapprint.gif">See 
    Genesis 2:8-15</a>). The very timeliness, as well as the many other implications 
    of the discovery itself, immediately satisfied a great number of other historical 
    and theological questions (Biblical questions), and allowed to fall in place 
    many pieces of the cosmic puzzle, opening the way for other revelations. Thus, 
    we would accept Diop's contention if we were not subsequently led to the structure 
    of the Universal World Tree, the countenance of the Great Dragon, Leviathan, 
    and the whole realm of worlds above--which so obviously included levels of 
    consciousness that are also germain to the Indo-European state of mind. We 
    are also aware that many hold to the African-Genesis theory (not to be confused 
    with the theory of the origins of human life itself), for other than spiritual 
    or scholarly reasons. Historical Revisionism is a term used by some Europeans 
    to define what they perceive to be a wide range of attempts by certain Afro-centrist 
    scholars to exact a kind of intellectual vengeance on the white, Western world--no 
    matter what the cost. Diop says: &quot;It is the fruit of unwarranted supposition 
    by specialists convinced that everything valuable in life can come only from 
    their race and that, if we look carefully, we are sure to be able to prove 
    it. From then on it matters little whether the demonstration is supported 
    by facts.&quot; (pp.64,65). We agree. He then goes on to say:</font></p>

      are rooted in Egyptian cosmogony and science. One needs only to meditate

      The interpretation according to which Kemit designates the black soil of 
      Egypt, rather than the black man and, by extension, the black race of the 
      country of the Blacks, stems from a gratuitous distortion by minds aware 
      of what the exact interpretation of the word would imply. Thus it is natural 
      to find Kam in Hebrew meaning heat, black, burned. The inhabitants of Egypt,

</div>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Do we think that Diop is wrong when he says 
    that those who dwelt in ancient (that is, pre-dynastic) Egypt were Negroes? 
    Or even that there were not at various times pure Africans, or Blacks among 
    the Pharaohs and ruling classes of Egypt? Not at all. Or that there was not 
    a Natufian people living in the regions of Palestine in that distant time? 
    Not at all. But if one has been following the chapters of this work to this 
    point they know how stretched and tortured we believe Diop's narration to 
    be, for reasons we will rehearse again here. Diop allows a European presence 
    in Egypt as early as the 11th dynasty, much later then the reign of Menes 
    and the founders of the first Dynasties and the builders of the great pyramids 
    and sphinxs. He says:</font></p>

<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But the whole 
      history of Egypt, as we shall see, shows that the mixture of the early population

  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">We, however--and not for racial reasons as some might reason--have 
    placed this contact as far back in Egyptian history as we place these same 
    Indo-European influences upon the indigenous culture of Persia and India. 
    (Please see the commentary on the <a href="SideLinks/VedicConnection.htm">Vedic 
    Connection</a>). We say it occurred roughly about the same time--even before 
    the more barbaric, white, conquering tribes of nomadic <i>Canaanites</i> appeared 
    out of Europe in the lands of the East. (Genesis 10:18). (We have also placed 
    the center of the biblical, purely literary, land of Canaan in Europe as well, 
    because this is where the stories of the purely literary and archetypal figures 
    of Japheth, Shem and Ham originated. And as such we shall see how the name 
    of these &quot;cursed&quot; Canaanites, as well as the name &quot;Ham&quot; 
    itself, the forebear of Nimrod, the son of Cush--literary names devised by 
    the Hebrew adepts and scribes to describe the overall nature of the Western 
    inhabitants of the Indo-European world--were carried into the East by these 
    same adepts for very certain historical and prophetic reasons. Because it 
    was there in Egypt, and in the person of the Egyptian Pharaohs, that the prophets 
    began to lay the historic foundations for the Mystery of Iniquity. Nimrod, 
    the primary archetype of the political <i>strongman </i>in the earth (the 
    antichrist of the New Testament), would appear over time in the Seven successive 
    figures of (1) Pharaoh; (2) The Assyrian; (3) the king of Babylon; (4) Haman 
    the Persian; (5) Alexander; (6) Caesar ; (7) Napolean who strode so majestically 
    across the Holy Roman Empire of his time; and then finally in the Eighth: 
    the office of the Presidents of the United States. The office of the American 
    presidency is all of these Seven in one. (Please understand Revelation 17:9-11, 
    and Matthew 12:43-45). </font></p>

    upon which the entire cult of Nimrod would be built in the world, and that 
    these mysteries would be carried in time back to the Western ends of the earth 
    from which they sprang...see Ezekiel 31 and 32). And, thus, these earliest 
    adepts in the higher mysteries brought with them into Egypt the same structural 
    ideas of the universe as they brought into India--ideas that were later built 
    into the structure of the great pyramids themselves. We are referring to those 
    adepts in higher mysteries who ranged over the entire ancient world of that 
    time in the spirit of Manu/Adam/Man, but particularly in the spirit of Abel. 
    They came out of the great emerging struggles of those times, born in the 
    conflict between the forces of Light and the forces of Darkness. They were 
    not only the first (creative) monotheists but also the first pacifists. (One 
    cannot be one without being the other). They came out of the West; and following 
    the course of the Rivers of Eden they found their way to the headwaters of

  <p><font size="+1">Diop then goes on to say: &quot;This legend which must belong 
    to an ancient tradition, seems to me to merit attention. It agrees completely 
    with what Greek historians tell us, namely, that Egypt was a colony of Ethiopia. 
    Thus the Egyptians, at least those who became the Pharonic Egyptians probably 
    followed the course of the Great River.&quot; (p.92). He is correct, except 
    that he has the influence flowing in the wrong direction. </font></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Do we think that Africans, or Blacks, were part of this ancient 
    Fellowship of the Mystery? Absolutely. There is evidence of an African presence 
    in the ancient Americas, just as there was a certain <i>Ni'ger</i> present 
    among the prophets and teachers at Antioch. (Acts 13:1). But the idea that 
    the Mystery itself is rooted in a purely African state of mind is simply not 
    grounded in historical fact. It came down upon Egypt from the higher Egypt, 
    from the West and from the North. Diop says that the Hebrew scribes attributed 
    the name of Ham, and the curse upon Canaan, to the Black race because of their 
    animosities toward those peoples, and that present-day Palestine was the land 
    of Canaan toward which the white, uncivilized Hebrew people came in the time 
    of Abraham. We suggest, first of all, that the reason the history of this 
    so named Ham cannot be discovered anywhere in Africa, outside of strenuous 
    attempts to reconstruct and place it there, is because Ham was not a real 
    individual person to begin with. He was, rather, one part of a trinity of 
    archetypal figures--Ham, Shem, and Japheth--created by these same adepts in 
    the Hebrew mysteries to delineate not only the geo-metaphorical dimensions 
    of the World Tree (the West, the Center, and the East), but also the structure 
    of the entire human life-force, composed as all of us are of Body, Soul, and 
    Spirit. And if the name of Ham got associated with Egypt, and somehow with 
    the Ethiopian peoples in the East, it is because the lower extremities of 
    Egypt--the lower, Western ends of the earth--were meant. Look into the Oracles, 
    and see how the Western ends of the earth lie everywhere below the Navel of 
    this great mystery. This is the lower realm, the realm of the Flesh if you 
    will, where all of the metaphysical and spiritual effects of Adam's lower 
    nature are being worked out to cosmic perfection. Thus it is the Western end 
    of the earth, and the white race that rules over it, not the Black race, that 
    bears the ultimate &quot;curse,&quot; for these ancient adepts knew how wickedness 
    would be completed here, and how the final judgments of God would fall on 
    this place at the end of the age:</font></p>

      who lived there were called 'Tuatiu.' The meaning of the name Tat, or Tuat, 
      is unknown, and it is useless to speculate upon it or invent etymologies 
      for it; it was applied to the home of the beatified spirits and the damned, 
      no doubt in prehistoric times, and the exact meaning which it conveyed to

      of the Tuat; it ran parallel with the mountains, and was on the plane either 
      of the land of Egypt or of the sky above it...The Tuat had the shape of 
      a valley; and from the fact that it began near the place where the Sun set, 
      and ended near the place where he arose, it is permissible to say that the 
      Tuat was nearly circular in form. That this is the view taken by the Egyptians 
      themselves is proved by the scene which produced in the Book of Gates. Here

      quite another faith and branch of the human family, who, by an impulse and 
      commission from heaven, and by the special aid of the Most High, induced

      times long after, to serve as a witness of inspiration, and of the truth, 
      and purposes of God, over against the falsities and corruptions of a degenerate

      The chief star in that group (Draconis) is situated in the monster's tail.

      Draconis, then, looked right down that inclined tube to the bottomless pit.

</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Hancock traces the route of the fabled Ark of the Covenant 
    from where he, and religious scholarship in general, believe Solomon's temple 
    was situated--at the site of present-day Jerusalem--up the Nile Valley to 
    the Blue River's headwaters beyond Sudan in Ethiopia. (There is an entire 
    school of thought emerging again in these times that is questioning, not only 
    the historical and archeological evidence of the Biblical accounts of the 
    reigns of David and Solomon--or rather the total lack of it--but whether the 
    Bible is a literal record of literal historical events at all, which it is 
    not--not in the same sense as we understand and interpret history. It is a 
    record of extra-historical events, spiritual and archetypal events that are 
    still unfolding and coming to pass). There, Hancock believes, as do almost 
    all Jewish and Christian Ethiopians as well, the Ark was brought in the time 
    of the Hebrew kings (specifically as the result of a liaison between Solomon 
    and the just-as-fabled Queen of Sheba), and laid to rest. The Ark, however, 
    is never seen by any others than the select order of priest-keepers who have 
    charge of it. But images of it, or parts of it that strangely, or rather fittingly 
    enough, resemble not the Ark, but ship, or boat-boards, are brought out and 
    displayed at certain festive times in the year. These images, called <i>Tabotat</i>, 
    are paraded through the worshipful community in a grand, rousing ritual that 
    Hancock says resembles David's bringing the Ark up to Jerusalem... </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">As we begin to comprehend the dimensions of this mystery, 
    however--of the epic whereabouts of the Holy Temple City Above, how they conform 
    to those of the Cosmic World Tree, and how the roots of this Tree reach downwards 
    into the land of the original Ethiopia here in the West--one cannot fail to 
    detect and appreciate the further work of those master masons of the Hebrew 
    Mystery, whoever they were. That is, one cannot fail to see another example 
    of the principles of historic symmetry that they were working with--South 
    reflecting North, East reflecting West--thus not only the historical manner 
    in which these adepts built upon the foundation of this great Temple structure, 
    and how they recorded their design in the pages of what has become for us 
    the Sacred Scriptures, but also how they etched this design upon the sacred 
    beliefs, the myths and legends, of all the peoples throughout the earth. They 
    have drawn all of us together at last in the same mystery and to the same 
    common center. Everything in the Sacred Scriptures, as well as in the individual 
    beliefs of all other peoples, must be interpreted in this same light. Nor 
    can we fail in this light to understand the connections that exist between 
    the <a href="../UsedImages/pg29web.gif">Ark of the Covenant</a> and the mythological 
    Ark of Noah, which also conforms to the cosmic and historic dimensions of 
    the World Tree (please see chapter 4); and between these and the ark that 
    carried the infant Moses to the house of Pharaoh, or of the Solar bark of 
    Pharaoh itself that carries the mysteries of Egypt and the soul of man (please 
    see Ezekiel 31 and 32), from one side of the Mystery to the other--back to 
    the place, and to the Day of Resurrection here in the West:</font></p>

</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">We also begin to sense the meaning of the words: <i>The land 
    shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.</i> (Isaiah 
    18: 1). The rivers of Ethiopia, like the Rivers of Eden and as the Jordan 
    itself, are spiritual. They flow from one end of the heaven to the other, 
    and lead to those states of mind that in turn, and at last, lead to the Promised 
    State of Mind itself--that which was promised to all the seed of Abraham and 
    Sarah. It is that Pure Land that is sought by Buddhists, and promised by Brahma 
    and Sarasvati to all of those who have walked in their ways. (He, the Creator 
    of Heaven and Earth, and She, the Mother of the Four Vedas, thus of the Gospels 
    as well. She is the Goddess of all flowing rivers, [even of Time], and the 
    scriptural embodiment of Divine Wisdom herself, as Abrahm said of her, and 
    as it is written in the Proverbs: <i>Call Wisdom thy sister. </i>[Proverbs 
    7:4]. <i>She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold of Her; and happy is 
    everyone that retaineth Her...</i>Proverbs 3:18). Those who venture beyond 
    these rivers find themselves in a strange, spiritual land indeed..</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
  </div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Thus Hancock does well when he equates the Ark with Divine 
    Wisdom (which is exactly what was taken to Ethiopia in the figure of Menilek 
    the son of Solomon and Sheba), and when he equates it with others' search 
    for the Holy Grail (for the two are one), but goes astray when he thinks of 
    it as a literal &quot;death-dispensing, tower-raising, meteoric energy machine 
    from Atlantis.&quot; (Which, of course, in a certain metaphysical sense it 
    is (The Raiders of the Lost Ark notwithstanding). But Hancock has literally 
    gone from what he has called &quot;new-age nonsense&quot; to &quot;science-fiction 
    nonsense&quot;). The fellowship of Bet HaShem Midrash, who are involved in 
    the beginnings of a restoration of the allegorical principles of the Torah, 
    more fittingly equate the Ark with &quot;the mind coming to spiritual perfection&quot;:</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The ark...a 
      box; depository of Torah scrolls; literally, concepts of the mind, which 
      is the womb of potentiality. The ark is depicted in the Torah with specific 
      measurements to house the words of the Spirit. The Length is the mind of 
      patience, forbearance, endurance; the Width is the mind of generosity, comfort, 
      expansion; the Height is the mind of restoration, establishment, glorification, 
      and elevation.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Length also 
      expresses continuing renewal when mind is positioned as a child of Elohim; 
      the Breadth expresses the foundations of spiritual operations and performances; 
      and the Height conveys the freedom that comes in serving Elohim. As our 
      minds accept the design of the Spirit, they acquire the capacity to hold 
      the words of the Spirit.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">In his search for the Ark, Hancock encounters a sect of Ethiopians 
    named the <i>Qement</i>, and then leaves them without realizing that this 
    group has provided a key to the whole puzzle. It was stored away in their 
    own recollections, in their oral and ritual traditions:</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'A few remain...Even

      it is conducted as it should be, takes place in the open air. And we prefer

      special groves called &quot;degegna.&quot; Some--the &quot;degegna&quot;--were 
      used for annual ceremonies. They had been planted in the distant past when 
      the founder of the Qement religion was shown the correct location in his 
      dreams...In addition there were many other similar sites, called &quot;qole&quot;Which 
      often consisted of only a single tree where a particularly powerful spirit 
      was believed to reside. The &quot;qole&quot; were normally situated in high 
      places.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The founder of the 
      Qement religion was called Anayer. He came to Ethiopia so long ago. He came

</div>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">The implication is that these <i>Qement</i> 
    are not the remnant of any Hebrew sect from Palestine, but rather--because 
    of their ritual association with &quot;groves&quot; and &quot;trees,&quot; 
    and assembling in open spaces--of a Hebrew-Druidical order that accompanied 
    the mysteries of the Tree of Life out of Europe in earlier times. Davidson

<div align="center">
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">but also goes on to say:</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There was 
      certainly no automatic or mechanical transfer of ideas. This drift of peoples 
      and their ideas about human origin, earthly and divine, may have wandered 
      up and down the continent, or may have come steadily from the north and 
      northeastward: it is in any case no more true that Egyptian or Kushite, 
      or Carthiginian, or Libyan civilization was installed in pale reflection 
      among the peoples of the south than it is true that the dominant ideas of 
      the eastern Mediterranean, pushing northward into savage or barbarian Europe 
      at about the same time or somewhat earlier, were reproduced in the same 
      form or with the same consequences on the margins of the North Sea...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is equally 
      no case, one may emphasize for supposing a one-way traffic in the diffusion

      Africa. Dynastic Egypt was not born into a void, it emerged from a neolithic 
      womb, and this womb was African.&quot; </font>p.63<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Our contention in these matters (as was Diop's), is that 
    the Hebrew religion originated in the main from an Indo-European span of thought 
    (which Diop labeled wholly barbaric, and indeed it almost seems to be), and 
    that Semiticism itself is that branch of Indo-European thought that found 
    its way in ancient times into the East, and into the South, and into the languages 
    and thought-forms of all the peoples to whom it came. We do not contend that 
    the adepts of these Hebrew mysteries were not instructed in many archetypal 
    and complimentary ways by those among whom they came, or that these adepts 
    were all of the Caucasian type. We know the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic tradition 
    to be syncretistic through and through. We assume a <i>Fellowship</i> of the 
    Mystery then, composed of every race, as will become evident again in our 
    own times. Thus we will let the dynamics of these ideas speak for themselves, 
    and simply reason that these archetypal beliefs--(the religion of Egypt for 
    instance), even if they originally entered the Hebrew, and thus the European 
    state of mind from Africa as Davidson seems to contend--were totally applicable 
    to the structure of the Northern mysteries to which they came (or returned), 
    and are finding their fulfillment in no other place on earth than here in 
    the West--in the Egypt of America. Our contention is also, that while it may 
    be true (for the sake of personal and cultural feelings) that Egyptian civilization 
    was not installed in the South as a &quot;pale reflection&quot; of the Northern 
    world-view, the great spiritual events that are unfolding in the North, and 
    in the West, are, nevertheless, directly mirrored in the rituals and beliefs 
    of the peoples of both the East (the great <a href="../UsedImages/pg738.gif">pilgrimage 
    to Mecca</a> for instance), and the South. They are reflected in the myths 
    and legends of the Baobab Tree whose branches are buried upside down in the 
    African soil, and whose roots are pointed upwards into the sky above. Davidson 
    in fact traces the elements of this mirror image, of the northern Solar route 
    to America, in a section on the Great African Migration Legend:</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Meroe (a city 
      lost in time) fell to the Ethiopian power of Axum in the fourth century 
      A.D., and vanished from the scene. Within four hundred years of its eclipse 
      the written records of West Africa begin...They begin with Walib ibn Munabbeh, 
      who wrote in 738. To begin with they are mainly records of migration, footnotes 
      in Arabic to the ceaseless peopling of an African interior whose presence 
      was still obscured by myth and legend. Here was the earliest statement of 
      West Africa's great 'migration legend' that would echo and re-echo for long 
      centuries thereafter...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two hundred years 
      later the greatest of the medieval Arab geographers, El Mus'udi, would give 
      fresh life to this migration legend. 'When the descendants of Noah spread 
      across the earth...the sons of Kush, the sons of Canaan traveled toward 
      the West and crossed the Nile. There they separated. Some of them, the Nubians 
      and the Beja and the Zani, turned rightward between the East and the West; 
      but others, very numerous marched toward the setting sun...'</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Somewhere behind 
      this legend of migration from the valley of the Nile there may lay a large 
      core of historic truth. Coming from the eastward and northwestward, migratory 
      peoples or groups of peoples...racially mixed, partially civilized, would 
      enter the Western Sudan in a long procession of invasion and settlement 
      whose ordering and limits practically escape all knowledge. One may guess 
      at the pressures that made them move.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whom did these incoming 
      migrants--these 'Judeo-Syrian' groups, for example, to whom tradition awards 
      the foundation of Ghana in about AD 300--find in the Western Sudan, whither 
      they obscurely went?...It is at least clear that by the time of Ibn Munabbeh, 
      at the beginning of the eighth century, incoming migrants had mixed and 
      mingled with Negro peoples whom they found until one more or less had completely 
      absorbed the other.' (pp.53,54).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are now at the 
      point where the lines of inward-coming migration start to merge. The arrival 
      of these peoples from the northeast and east whose ceaseless movement would 
      offer the material of legendary history for Ibn Munabbeh...With El Mas'udi's 
      restatement of the legend those sons of Kush 'very numerous, who marched 
      toward the setting sun,' have acquired an historically attested direction: 
      They 'marched in the direction of Zaghawa, Kanem, Marka, Kawkaw, and Ghana, 
      and other countries of the blacks...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point is that 
      they 'marched' most precisely from the middle-Nile to the middle-Niger: 
      along a trans-African route, that is, which migrating peoples had undoubtedly 
      used from times that are exceedingly remote...There is practically no well-known 
      peoples of West Africa without its legend of an eastern of northern origin 
      in the remote past.&quot; </font>The Lost Cities of Africa, (pp.59,60)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>

</div>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">It should be noted in passing that Davidson 
    mentions several rock engravings found along this same sub-Sahara route, of 
    Nile boats, and horse-drawn chariots. He attributes them to local artists, 
    who, may we add, must have had a sense of the Merkabah, or Solar Chariot mysteries 
    that were germain to this migration legend, and which were understood in one 
    sense or another by that universal Fellowship of Hebrew adepts wherever they 
    were found throughout the earth.</font></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">That individuals and even whole groups were initiated into 
    these mysteries, from olden times, is evidenced by Evan Zuesse. In his <i>Ritual 
    Cosmos </i>he tells of the <i>Bambara</i>, a Mande people of Mali:</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Mande 
      have had one of the most glorious traditions of all the peoples of the Western 
      Sudan, and at one time the Bambara controlled an empire extending thousands 
      of square miles...Nevertheless, the Bambara appeared to French authorities 
      of the colonial period as a 'typical African peasantry.'...It remained for 
      a later investigator...to discover that these 'peasants' had a philosophy 
      of the universe equal in complexity and profundity to the systems of Pythagorus 
      or Plotinus, Aquinas, Spinoza, of Bergson. The Bambara, it now appears, 
      have precisely the same assumptions as the Mbuti...but have worked out the 
      details into a profound philosophy embracing all parts of a far more complex 
      universe. The philosophy is communicated to the initiate as he rises through 
      the ranked mask societies.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bambara have 
      an almost gnostic view of initiation. As did the Gnostics, they believe 
      that the essence of transformation is the communication of saving knowledge. 
      The doctrines that constitute this knowledge is taught in six stages...Those 
      who have passed through all the stages are 'new beings' 'fully male,' spiritually 
      enlightened and endowed with the 'word,' that is, possessing an immortal 
      soul that bears the form of the universe and God himself.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet despite this 
      heavy stress on knowledge, when we look closely at the actual process of 
      initiation itself we find the same psychological and spiritual transformations 
      operating that we found in the Ndembu initiation of girls. Clearly, it is 
      not knowledge that is the true core of initiatic transformation but the 
      displacement of the Self, by breaking down the body image, into a new transcendental

  <p><font size="+1">This mirrored connection between the hidden (Biblical) traditions 
    of Europe and African spiritual culture is further reflected in the rituals 
    of the Ila tribe. Here the people share ritually in the same struggles that 
    have been waged between the children of Light and the children of Darkness 
    throughout the centuries (particularly since the time of Christ), and seem 
    to look prophetically into the last days here in the West, wherein the spirit 
    of antichrist itself holds sway over the mind and the activities of the community:</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The most significant 
      of Ila festivals is the new year's festival in the spring. Its symbolisms 
      sum up the theme of the other annual celebrations...It appears that the 
      entire festival is a reenactment of myths of founding and of the beginning 
      of time and culture. The ceremonies begin with an invocation to Shimunenga, 
      who as ancestral first settler and hero showed the way to overcome formlessness 
      and to initiate human culture, and who as present demi-god still guides 
      his descendants through the same drama. The ceremonies center...on fertility 
      themes and conclude with an enactment of political conquest of the land 
      by the young men (who thus embody and reexperience the culture hero)...They 
      charge out of the cattle pens in war regalia, penetrating the primal wilderness 
      around the villages and taking possession of it, while the women gather 
      and sing praises to their virility. Giving war cries, shaking their spears, 
      the warriors pair off into opposing armies and 'attack' each other again 
      and again in the days that follow. This is also the time when in battle 
      dress the men ceremoniously lead the cattle to new pasturage near the river 
      (for the waters have long since receded and local pastures dried up).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then...in the most 
      important dances the women gather to sing ribald, 'phallic' songs at the 
      groves. The 'obscenity' of the songs and dances is very important, precisely 
      because the Ila are ordinarily so puritanical in their language. This is 
      especially true of the women. To refer to a person's genitals is deeply 
      humiliating, and to make mention of the sexual act or one's own sexual prowess 
      is even more scandalous. All of these things reduce one to a mere bodily 
      function, and depersonalize one. The body image is assaulted and the ego's 
      control distorted...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly when the 
      Ila sing 'phallic' songs they feel the INVERSION of things. Other rituals 
      of the new year confirm this feeling. The men roam about the village in 
      roudy groups, seeking out prominent men of the community (to insult them). 
      For example, such groups came before the village headman Chidyboloto, and 
      sang out the following affront: 'Boloto sat as an owl; throw a firestick 
      at him and make him fly away!' The meaning can only be that Boloto is a 
      witch...Despite the deadly insult of the choristers' song, sufficient at 
      any other time to invoke fierce resentment and the imposition of fines, 
      if not worse, the headman had to accept their remarks humbly, and even to 
      give them beer in turn. Insults on this day could and did fly in all directions 
      and were aimed at anyone in power by the roaming bands...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the tone of 
      the annual festival is exultant. Following the day devoted to Nachilomwe, 
      in which all these events take place, worship shifts to Shimunenga the culture-hero. 
      Just as in the beginning of time the primordial world of Nachilomwe had 
      no rule or form until the culture-hero brought order and separated out the 
      primary classifications...the men parade their cattle before the great ancestor 
      and demonstrate to what degree they have absorbed his virility with mock 
      battles (again) of glorious athletics and pageantry.&quot; </font>Ritual

  <p><font size="+1">And then Zuesse says: &quot;We can feel the power of the 
    Ila festival, but what in fact is the logic behind all this? Why is it necessary 
    every year to have SUCH STRANGE UPSIDE DOWN BEHAVIOR? What is the connection 
    of this with the other festivals of the Ila with their life-cycle rites and 
    ordinary day-to-day life? And how is it that such peculiar behavior is thought 
    to regenerate the fields, insure the fertility of women, multiply the cattle,cause 
    the rains to come, and appease the spirits and God himself?&quot;...</font></p>

    women represent the Great Mother herself, who is laboring everywhere throughout 
    the earth bringing forth the Coming Age. (See chapter 5). The cattle are symbolic 
    of the people themselves. (Malachi 4:2). And the rain represents the Spirit 
    of God that shall descend upon the people, bringing forth the Word again at 
    the end of the age. (See Matthew 13:3; Malachi 3:10-12; James 5:8). And the 
    men in power represent the present rulers of the Western world--and particularly 
    the spirit of the American Antichrist that rules among them.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The original 
      form of human spiritual expression was animism, in which nature was seen 
      as sacred itself. This took various forms. There was a sense of the sacred 
      in the land as a whole: the earth was alive. Topography could be anthropomorphised--here 
      were hills that looked like breasts of Mother Earth, there a rocky cragg 
      that looked like the face of a god. The landscape became the place for legendary 
      events and beings, the creatures of mythic time. In a slightly more focused 
      form of animism, selected places such as hilltops, rocks, trees, waterfalls, 
      and so on were seen as being inhabited by spirits--hence the idea of 'spirit 
      of place,' ('genius loci' or 'locus sanctus').</font></p>

      world in order to seek information required by the tribe. </font>(As did 
      Paul, as well as Muhammad, and as the author of Job did in order to visualize 
      the presence of Behemoth and Leviathan)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
      The shaman could see back in time and was the repository of tribal history. 
      He or she could even see ahead in time and predict coming events...An important 
      element in Shamanism, as we shall discover, was the ability to travel in 
      mind through (or above) the environment and observe distant events.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The basic shamanic 
      cosmology consisted of Three worlds, the Middle Earth of human reality, 
      the Upper world of spiritual beings, and the hellish Underworld. Access 
      to these otherworlds was by means of a conceptual Axis that linked them: 
      a World-Tree, a Cosmic Mountain...By symbolically traveling along this axis, 
      in whatever form, the shaman could ascend to heaven or enter deeply into 
      the body of the Earth, the Underworld.</font></p>

      became more structured and hierarchal, theocracies appeared: Religious rule,

      inadequacy of </font>(Western)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      attempts to understand the depths of African religious life can best be 
      shown through an example, the institution of 'bwami,' an initiatic cult 
      of the Lega, a Bantu farming culture of eastern Zaire. The Lega are a numerous 
      people, scattered over a vast area of the Congo forest in small villages...Since 
      they lack centralized kingship, the villagers would be utterly isolated 
      from each other were it not for 'bwami'. It is their 'king' (bwami means 
      'king'). People gather for its celebrations from entire regions. Bwami is 
      entirely apart from general village society; its elders exemplars of calm 
      poise, abstain from fierce local village politics. Village chiefs and even 
      the regional priests of the earth (Nenekisi) do not necessarily attain high 
      initiatic rank in the society; it stands for a more universal truth...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what is the 
      nature of the transcendental reality Bwami serves? Clearly it is not wholly 
      Other. Bwami does not insist on personal salvation...it requires no sacrificial 
      rites nor even prayers. It does not even center on a personal deity, although 
      it is important to add the Lega believe bwami aids Kingunga (God)...against 
      Kaginga (evil, chaos).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bwami is a sterling 
      example of a fundamental type of spirituality very widespread in African 
      religions, the religion of structure...Religions of salvation have a low 
      estimation of all that is relative, due to their longing for what is absolute 
      and immutable...real. Religions of structure find fulfillment in the norms 
      and eternal relationships which structure all processes and change in this 
      world. The first revels in...anomalous and extreme states because they betoken 
      the exceptional breakthrough into unworldly eternity; the second rejoices 
      in the sanctification of every day life, and finds eternity in the midst 
      of change...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can we discover 
      the specific form of religious intentionality, the actual structure 'per 
      se' that a given religious maze contains? Biebuyck tells us that bwami (employs 
      a system of seemingly unrelated proverbs, as well as rituals, to convey 
      bwami truths and values, as well as social, spacial, and cosmic relationships)...Many 
      of the proverbs affirm the centrality of Bwami itself in the world. It is 
      the focus of the universe, the central fact. 'The middle pole sustains the 
      forest hut; when the pole is removed, the hut collapses.' The implication 
      would seem to be that without bwami, all culture as such would disintegrate, 
      and the wilderness would invade the village which exists in the center of 
      things. Another proverb also stresses the mystical centrality of bwami by 
      comparing it to a Cosmic Tree. 'Bwami: the lukundu tree has made its butresses 
      and arial roots reach far.' Yet another makes a provocative comparison with 
      the heavenly moon, serenly ruling over every thing, equidistant and transcendent 
      over all social groups as well: 'Bwami, the crescent of the moon, every 
      clan is seen from it.' In the important summary offered by another proverb, 
      'The words of the land are things that tie together, things that transform, 
      like the clouds, things that are high, like the sky.'&quot; </font>(pp.5-9)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<div align="left"><font size="+1">Of the Ila people, Zuesse writes:</font> 
  <blockquote>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Ila lack 
    genuine kingship. It is clear from these accounts however, that the ultimate 
    logic of their ceremonies goes back to the rule of kingship...When we turn 
    to the ceremonies of kingship still practiced or recently practiced by other 
    Lunda peoples, we find that the ideas of priestly leadership, or 'divine kingship' 
    as it has sometimes been called, provide a complete code that deciphers Ila 
    conceptions of chieftanship and its relation to the earth. Fundamentally the 
    earth is a feminine space, and the institution of ancestral kingship (and 
    male authority) is likened to a marriage--a marriage instigated by heaven, 
    which begins real time. That is, 'male' heaven, kingship, culture, and the 
    ancestors (and therefore time) are brought together with the feminine earth, 
    nature, and sacred space. Here again cosmological ideas are used to guide 
    as closely as possible the community's social behavior...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The king is the unity 
    of the people and the land. He is truly semi-divine, a priestly figure as 
    well as a political one...'When the king dies, the nation falls into a coma.' 
    Lozi say, fires are put out (at least in theory) until his successor with 
    the help of the priest of Mbuyamwambina (wife of God), lights new fires with 
    frictionsticks. This fire is distributed to all the villages to rekindle their 
    fires. Then the people cook and warm themselves by 'the fire of the king so-and-so.'</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Already in this account 
    we see dual sexual oppositions suggested in which the king is symbolically 
    complimentary to the land and needs the services of 'the wife of God' to light 
    the generative fire and renew life. The symbols are made clearer by Lozi political 
    geography. The kingdom is divided into two parts, north and south, without 
    any external geographical necessity for this division. Each province has a 
    ruler: the northern king (called 'the Great One of the Earth') is politically 
    primary, while the southern ruler (Earth of the South, or Princess Chief) 
    is dominant in a priestly way. Despite the title...the southern ruler did 
    not need to be female until recently, but we are told that the founder of 
    the southern part was female. And the two halves of the kingdom are symbolically 
    wed to each other...and in another symbolism the south is the Mother to the 
    living king and the north.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In effect, then, the 
    Lozi have a structure of a semi-divine king symbolically wed to the priest(ess) 
    of the earth, which is so common in African religions. It is interesting to 
    observe that the wedding of these two...can be represented through ritual 
    intercourse, or symbolisms of war and conquest, possession and/or death. These 
    associations are hinted at, for example, in the Lozi installation ceremonies, 
    when the priest of the wife of God escorts the king to Makono, the home and 
    ancestral grave of the divine queen mother, 'to fetch kingship.' Is the king 
    the symbolical husband, or the son, of this original ancestress of the royal 
    family? Perhaps both.</font></p>

    king spends the night in vigil by a small lake out of which comes a monster 
    to hold communion with him...In some cultures, the earth-spirit is said to 
    transform itself into a Great Serpent...and go down into a lake or river, 
    or a shrine, where kings must still contact it through mediums or even human 
    sacrifice...The Korekore say that Nyanehwe, the ancestral culture-hero, defeated

    directly on God, just as they say He is responsible for creation of the universe. 
    Leza is the ultimate ancestor. The year is called quite simply 'the day of 
    God.'...Leza is the source of each person's destiny, which is directly controlled 
    by God without any intermediate spirits intervening...Within the eon of the 
    year, endlessly circling through its seasons, each segment is distinguished 
    by the specific activities occurring in it...In the largest sense, the seasons 
    are the activities of Leza...the storms are his visible presence. When it 
    thunders people say, 'Leza is thundering;' when lightning strikes, Ila murmur, 
    'Leza is fierce.' All things struck by lightning, including humans, have been 
    punished or chosen by Leza...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three major seasons 
    are marked off by ritual celebrations, so we find rituals of time defining 
    the divine order at its joints just as the rituals of space do.&quot;</font></p>

        MUST DIE, A SACRIFICIAL VICTIM</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The meanings 
    of funary rituals are more applicable to our topic than one might at first 
    suspect, even in details. For the model (or exaggerated form) of the ritual 
    abasement of Ila chiefs...can be located in the rituals that typically surround 
    the death (often the murder) of a divine king, and the installation of his 
    successor. Just as the Ila chief is insulted at 'the end of time' for failing 
    to live up to chiefly ideals, the king is often killed or dies an unnatural 
    death when he fails to live up to the ideals of divine kingship established 
    at the beginning of time. This failure and death brings time to an end in 
    cultures with kingship structures, and there follows an interregnum with precisely 
    the symbolic features of the Ila new year: adultery, confusion, mockery of 
    leaders, general chaos. That is, what happens every year to bring the cosmic 
    cycle to a close is repeated in divine kingship at the end of a reign, as 
    if a reign were symbolically like a year.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The similarities go 
    further: just as the king is the embodiment of the culture-hero and repeats 
    the history of the culture-hero (even of creation)...so the Shilluk king of 
    the lower Nile is probably the most discussed kingship of this type. Some 
    have even called it an archaic survivor of the primal cultures behind ancient 
    Egyptian religion.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Shilluk form of 
    divine kingship has in any case sparked the greatest controversy. The basic 
    traits are clear enough, however, Shilluk kings never die. Each king is really 
    the re-embodiment of the first king, Nyikang. Like Shimunenga, he came long 
    ago to the land of the Shilluk, crossing the Nile (miraculously), conquered 
    the monstrous beings that lived there, and created out of them humanity. He 
    gave laws of culture and finally disappeared in the wind before his people's 
    eyes. Within the wind he still roams the land as vice-regent of God, and he 
    also takes on human form as a living king, possessing the king at his installation.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The candidate earned 
    the kingly stool by being (ritually) 'killed.' When messengers burst in upon 
    him to announce to him that the priests and provincial priests had chosen 
    him, they shouted: 'You are our Dinka slave; we want to kill you!' The candidate 
    received the glad news with an obligatory struggle and flight. He fled to 
    the south, where he gathered an army to resist the honor. Then from the north, 
    an eerie host of warriors descended against him, led by Nyikang himself, and 
    his priests. At every town the spirit army did battle, capturing the inhabitants, 
    taking their cattle, and enlisting their soldiers for further struggle. Finally 
    the two armies met, at the MID POINT OF THE KINGDOM, and the royal candidate 
    was captured and taken 'dead' into the capital...henceforth to be the embodiment 
    of Nyikang. There would follow further rites, including a ritual marriage 
    with a 'wife' from the Ororo clan and a speech before the people in which 
    'new laws' would be issued.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no doubt 
    that, when all the details of this extraordinary drama are reviewed, we must 
    conclude that the divine king is symbolically a sacrificial victim. It may 
    even be suggested that the former king and the new king are versions of each 
    other, the former king being killed actually (the deed being denied symbolically) 
    and the new king being killed symbolically (but not actually). These inversions 
    give redoubled emphasis to the symbolic nature of the entire proceedings.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only when we understand 
    that the new and the former king are the same person, moreover, can we comprehend 
    the meaning of the other symbolisms. The failings of the former king are given 
    their clearest meaning in the treatment according his replacement; all of 
    these failures are a kind of rebellion from Nyikang. The new king enacts the 
    rebellion explicitly...He (resists) the transcendental imperative of Nyikang; 
    he therefore 'disappears,' (taking on the form at one time of the sacrificial 
    ox, at another of the 'Dinka slave' that is in fact killed at the accession 
    of the new king as a scapegoat offering), finally appearing again as the corpselike 
    being that leads the southern army against Nyikang. But he is again captured 
    by Nyikang, placed on the stool and penetrated anew with the culture-hero's 
    spirit. The king is resurrected from his temporary death. 'The king is dead, 
    long live the king.'&quot; </font>Ritual Cosmos, by Evan Zuesse, (pp.117-119)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Journey With the 
    White Lions Into the Heart of Human Evolution</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1960 Vasamazulu 
    Credo Mutwa broke the &quot;Oath of Silence&quot; that had bound him and other 
    high shamans to a secret oral tradition. Mutwa understands that we live in 
    prophetic times, when it is imperitive to transmit knowledge to humanity at 
    large. In speaking of secrets intended only for the highest shamanic initiates, 
    it is believed that he has brought a curse upon himself, his children and 
    his children's children...Personally I have...come to regard Mutwa's delivery 
    of this oral tradition as an act of unparalleled courage--worthy of the highest-ranking 
    lion shaman I know him to be...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There could be no 
    clearer indication that this is not localised knowledge but that it signals 
    a system of enlightenment which crosses continents and centuries: what Mutwa 
    himself calls &quot;the Great Knowledge.&quot; This African shaman's understanding 
    of the lost language of the ancients (Ogham) corresponds with the inscriptions 
    deciphered on Easter Island; his African stories of &quot;white Gods&quot; 
    have bearing on the &quot;white God&quot; of the Meso-Americans; his knowledge 
    of the stars in the African skies takes us right back to the Ancient Egyptians. 
    While Mutwa has dedicated his life to handing over secrets from the Great 
    African Tradition, it remains for us to make the astonishing intercontinental 
    connections.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mutwa has lived under 
    condemnation ever since he broke the secret code, and delivered hidden knowledge 
    to the common man. Is his drive to reveal the truth so difficult to understand? 
    The Bible talks of &quot;knowledge&quot; in the same breath as &quot;forbidden 
    fruits.&quot; Why are we afraid of knowing the truth? Why has it been imprinted 
    upon our collective consciousness that knowledge is sinful, and why do we 
    fear the consequences of knowing? The first lesson of Lion shamanism is to 
    conquer fear. Fear is conquered through the principles of love, truth and 
    enlightenment. Himself a living embodiment of these founding principles of 
    Lion shamanism, Mutwa has been prepared to endure the great personal cost 
    of his courageous action. If it is true that we are living at a crucial evolutionary 
    watershed for humankind, it is imperitive that we open the routes to knowledge 
    which may have a critical part to play in our evolutionary development. </font>(pp.14,15)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In was Maria, the lion-shaman woman of Timbavati, who directed 
  the author to Credo Mutwa. It was she who first opened the author's mind to 
  the Lion-king mysteries of the African plains:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At my expression, Maria's expression 
    lightened with humor, and she remarked that Timbavati means &quot;the river 
    that never runs dry.&quot; This seemed a curious name for a region made up 
    entirely of empty watercourses and arid sodic deposits. She says it means 
    &quot;river of stars,&quot; the interpreter continued.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seemed (to me) she was referring 
    to the Milky Way which, come to think of it, never did run dry in the manner 
    of the Timbavati watercourses. &quot;She says it is the same river where the 
    White Lions come from.&quot; Now she had lost me. The fire was shining in 
    Maria's cloudy eye. She was looking straight at me. so that I felt the force 
    of her communication but could not identify it. &quot;Ask Maria to explain 
    further,&quot; I instructed the interpreter...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After listening to my translated 
    words, Maria made a curt, sweeping gesture to the sky above us...&quot;Maria 
    says that her ancestors have told her that a long time ago, when the river 
    was in the sky </font>(above)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> many 
    people died. When the river is in this position again, the same will befall 
    human beings.&quot; This was not very intelligible </font>(the author said

    it had an ominous end-of-the-world ring about it.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above us, the clarity of the night 
    was spangled with what looked like a watercourse of droplets: the Milky Way, 
    eternal &quot;river&quot; arching above Timbavati's dry plains, which gave 
    rise to the mysterious legends of White Lions. </font>(Please consider Genesis 
    49:8-10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Out here, under the brilliance

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White Lions of Timbavati, Credo. 
    I need to know about them. Maria tells me you are the one person alive who 
    knows the story of their origins. &quot;That is not true, ma'am. There are 
    many in our ranks who know the story, but are sworn to secrecy. It is only 
    I who have been bold enough to speak of such things...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maria had also revealed that Mutwa 
    was the custodian of some of the holiest artifacts of the African continent. 
    Over the course of future encounters, Mutwa would show me over fifty items 
    in his possession--great pieces of copper, bronze, verdite and crystal, some 
    once belonging to the mightiest of kings, some inscribed with cryptic symbols, 
    many dating from a time when, Credo Mutwa says, an ancient seafaring civilisation, 
    neither of African birth nor of African race, came to African shores...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was my grandfather, ma'am, 
    who was the only person capable of curing me when I was struck down by an 
    incurable sickness which had kept me bedridden and unconscious for three years 
    right here in Soweto. It was during this time that I had many terrifying visions, 
    ma'am, some of which we sangomas call the &quot;sacred dreams&quot; that occur 
    before you become a sangoma. I had the vision of the earth stretched out like 
    a lion-skin pegged at all four corners--north, south, east and west--with 
    the four lion brothers tearing at in four directions. WE call this dream :the 
    Sacred Dream of End Time&quot;...<i>Nedelo Ntulo</i>.&quot; In our tradition 
    we believe...that the universe is sustained by Four great forces and in the 
    center is the Fifth power, <i>Nxaka-Nxaka</i>, meaning &quot;confusion&quot; 
    or &quot;chaos.&quot; From this power comes order and from order again comes 
    chaos--and so on for all eternity...</font></p>

    the time of the equinoxes to simulate the workings of the universe...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At first I could not understand 
    how the spirit of the Star Gods lives in every thing,&quot; Mutwa continued. 
    &quot;I was very stupid in those days. When I first asked my grandfather how 
    it was that everyone and everything has God within them...He took me outside...and 
    showed me his favorite Tree, a tall, fruit-bearing fig tree which he had planted 
    when he was a young man. He demanded what I thought this Tree was. I told 
    him, 'A tree, Grandfather.'...He told me that in the days when he himself 
    was a child in old Africa, and in the centuries before--in the time of our 
    Zulu ancestors--trees were not called 'trees' but 'growing people.'&quot;

  <p><font size="+1">In the realm of spiritual reality all is reflection, all 
    is ritual. &quot;As above, so below.&quot; <i>As in heaven, so on earth</i>. 
    As in the Mind of God so in the activities of nature and the course of human 
    history. Looking into the oracles we see that these precepts are also reflected 
    in the words: As in the East so in the West, and, as in the North so in the 
    South. Ritual is Heaven's way of including the whole human family in the unfolding 
    cosmic drama of human redemption, even though everyone is not near center 
    stage and seem not to be otherwise partaking of it themselves. The great Pilgrimage 
    to Mecca, as we have already noted, has been God's way of keeping the Islamic 
    peoples of the East connected to those things that have actually been coming 
    to pass in the world above--in the North and West. The Holy Qur'an must be 
    read in this singular light. Passover (in the East) and the High Holy Days 
    (in the West) have kept the Jewish peoples of the earth directly connected 
    to the Christian mysteries which they so otherwise ignore, and Christians 
    to their own mysteries which they are so otherwise ignorant of. Or the Catholic 
    Mass itself, which also reflects the mysteries that are unfolding in the lives 
    of real people--in the lives of all those in the world who have ever been 
    called to make an offering of themselves for righteousness' sake since the 
    time of Christ. (The Evening Sacrifice is still to be offered)...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Likewise, we must see in the rituals, and in the history 
    of African peoples, a mirrored reflection of those same things that have been 
    coming to pass along the Northern Solar route. They connect us all--even those 
    who have not made Mid-Passage themselves. Those who have, and who have overcome 
    the lower, natural tendencies of the self, of the group, of the nation, and 
    of the world itself--in ways that others in the earth have not (because of 
    this peculiar encounter with Darkness here in the West)--have come to the 
    Day of Redemption. They have come to the realization that every living Soul 
    is a reflection of the Divine Presence, and that every single Individual on 
    earth is connected to the Center, and is an essential player in the whole 
    drama of Life. The curtain will fall on the events of this age--a momentous 
    climax, a clash of angels and men, the death of a remnant (indeed, the final 
    death-throes of a Divine Mystery), and the resurrection of the people--and 
    will open again upon the stage of the age-to-come. And though many will not 
    directly partake in the final scene (except through the modern wonder of electronics), 
    all <i>who are alive and remain</i> will partake in the Resurrection that 
    follows. God will raise up to the world a king named D.V.D., a Male and Female 
    in perfect balance (a reflection of all that is divine in all others), and 
    the Law shall go forth from Zion. So shall the Love of God go forth, as knowledge 
    and justice is carried forth by God's children into all the corners of the 
    earth, and as the Throne of David itself passes through marriage and selection 
    to every single race of people on earth. There is only one True Race, the 
    Human Race, and only one True Religion, the Religion of Love.</font></p>
