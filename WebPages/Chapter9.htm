<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have 
    gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. </font></i><font size="3">(See

  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore I take you to record this day,</font></i><font size="+1"><i>THAT 
    I AM PURE FROM THE BLOOD OF ALL MEN</i></font><i><font size="+1">. </font></i>(In 
    other words, whoever they are that have anything to do with the shedding of 
    blood, with warfare between nations, or the taking of human life, no matter 
    what the reason, have nothing to do with Paul or his doctrine of Christ. They 
    did not learn it from him). </p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I have not shunned to declare unto you ALL the counsel 
    of God.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,

    the blood of all the righteous and the suffering in the earth)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><i>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse 
    things to draw away disciples after them. </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of Three 
    years I ceased not to warn you Night and Day with tears.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word

    Deut.31:10-30)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Some fifty years or more after Paul passed from the historical 
  scene, written Gospels began to appear and were added to the canon of accepted 
  church documents, among these were the writings of Paul himself. In the Gospel 
  of John we read:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except 
    it be given him from heaven,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the 
    Christ, but that I am sent before him.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend 
    of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because 
    of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled...</font></i><font size="+1">(John 
    3:27-29).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Who is John referring to? Turning back to Paul's 
  writings we find him alluding to Psalm 19:1-6 (<i>Which is as a bridegroom coming 
  out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race</i>), when he 
  says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1"> That I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have 
    not run in vain, neither labored in vain...</font></i><font size="+1">(Philippians 
    2:15,16). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Please discover in the text from the Book of John one of many 
  instances where the Gospels are cryptically referring to Paul (or Elisha), who 
  came after John the Baptist, and who will appear again in our own time at the 
  Eighth emanation on the Tree of Life named Majesty, as it is also written: <i>The 
  kingdom of heaven is like a certain King who made a marriage for His son. </i>(Matthew 
  22:2)... </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when the sons of the prophets...saw him, they said, 
    The spirit of Elijah doth rest upon Elisha. And they came to meet him, and 
    bowed themselves to the ground before him...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Kings 2:15).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Or as the apostle Peter will say:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; 
    even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him 
    hath written unto you;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">As also in ALL his epistles, speaking in them of these 
    things; in which are some things hard to be understood </font></i>(see Hebrews 
    5:11-14)<font size="+1"><i>, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, 
    as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction</i>...(2 
    Peter 3:14-16). </font></p>

<p align="center"><b>1 Corinthians, chapter 2; 2 Corinthians 12, and 13...KJV</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> But we have devoted the previous chapter to it. By the time 
  of the First Council of Nicaea, with all of the conflicts and arguments about 
  the person and the nature of Christ that attended it, it will be evident that 
  the Mystery of Christ had been successfully sealed from even the mind of Christendom 
  itself. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For what things foreigners, 
    when they solemnize such festivals, are not able to observe but for a few 
    days' time, and call them Mysteries and Sacred Ceremonies, we observe with 
    great pleasure and an unshaken resolution the whole of our lives. What are 
    the things, then, that we are commanded or forbidden? They are simply and 
    easily known. The first commandment is concerning God, and affirms that God 
    contains all things, and is a being in every way perfect and happy, and self-sufficient, 
    AND SUPPLYING ALL OTHER BEINGS; THE BEGINNING, THE MIDDLE, AND THE END OF 
    ALL THINGS. </font>(In other words, God is realized in the life of every living 
    soul, and in the sum of every natural and human event, past and present. <i>The 
    same yesterday, today, and forever</i>...&quot;Happy,&quot; however, is not 
    a word we would use to describe God's disposition in the 20th century. Fierce 
    and Terrible in judgment describes it better)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    He is manifest in His works and benefits, and (is) more conspicuous than any 
    other being whatsoever; but as to His form and magnitude he is most obscure 
    </font>(to the unaided eye that is)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    All materials, be they ever so costly, are unworthy to compose an image for 
    Him; and all arts are unartful to express the notion that we have of Him...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We see His works, the Light, the 
    Heaven, the Sun and the Moon, the Waters, the generations of Animals, the 
    production of Fruits. These things have God made, not with hands, not with 
    labour, not as wanting the assistance of any to cooperate with Him; but as 
    His will resolved that they should be made, and be good also...All men ought 
    to follow this Being, and to worship him in the exercise of virtue; for this 
    way of worship of God is the most holy of all others. </font>(Those who have 
    formulated elaborate rituals and liturgies to guide themselves in these mysteries 
    might say that Josephus is encouraging us to a form of Nature worship. But 
    the objective of every ritual is finally to bring about an attitude of worship 
    toward the God of Nature Itself, Himself, Herself, Themselves--They are ALL 
    ONE)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There ought also to be ONE TEMPLE 
    FOR ONE GOD; for likeness is the constant foundation of agreement. This temple 
    ought to be common to all men, because He is the common God of all men. HIS 
    PRIESTS ARE TO BE CONTINUALLY ABOUT HIS WORSHIP.&quot; </font>Josephus, Contra 
    Apion, Book II.22-24<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">As </font><font size="+1"> one comes to know the <i>Mystery 
  </i>they will realize how adept Josephus was in the <i>Mystery</i> itself. He 
  is hiding as much in his narrative as he reveals:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(He writes): <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now at the time 
    when this great concussion of affairs happened, the affairs of the Romans 
    themselves were in great disorder. Those Jews also, who were for innovations, 
    then arose when the times were disturbed; they were also in a flourishing 
    condition for strength and riches, insomuch that the affairs of the East were 
    exceedingly tumultuous, while some hoped for gain, and others were afraid 
    of loss in such troubles; for the Jews hoped that all their nation which were 
    beyond Euphrates would have raised an insurrection with them. The Gauls also, 
    in the neighborhood of the Romans were in motion, and the Celtae were not 
    quiet; but all was in disorder after the death of Nero...I thought it therefore 
    an absurd things to see the truth falsified in affairs of such consequence, 
    and to take no notice of it...&quot; </font>Preface to the Wars of the Jews<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is against the background of these great turmoils that Josephus 
  writes <i>The Antiquities </i>and<i> </i>the<i> Wars of the Jews</i>. It is 
  against this same background that we must discover the history and the formation 
  of the early Church. We have already seen, that even though we read in the early 
  narratives of the Church--the Book of Acts for instance, as well as in the works 
  of Josephus--of place-names, and of events pertaining to them, that the authors 
  are not always speaking of the same places that we think they are. But rather 
  they are drawing upon the existence of a <a href="../UsedImages/heavenlyyWorld-2.gif">secret 
  geographical and historical tradition</a>, wherein many of the religiously strategic 
  places and areas of the world at that time had an original, or corresponding 
  place of the same name somewhere else, either to the West, or above in the North 
  (and even in the South as we shall see, as we trace the Mysteries out of Africa 
  to America in these last days). Or, as in the case of the City of Jerusalem 
  itself, its Higher Counterpart is stretched out across the earth from one end 
  of the Mystery to the other...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The City Above, the Mother of Us All...(Galatians 4:24-26).</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus we find Paul &quot;hastening to be at Jerusalem on the 
  day of Pentecost.&quot; (Acts 20:16). And he arrives there, as it is written: 
  <i>And the brethren received him gladly</i> (Acts 21:17). But just where has 
  he arrived? We want to imagine that he arrived at that city in Palestine (but 
  it is very probable that Paul has never set foot in that city at all). The Book 
  of Acts has him at Jerusalem at the time of the martyrdom of Stephen (as well 
  as several other times), and he says so himself. (Acts, chapter 7; 22:19,20). 
  But we have placed these events in the city of Vindebona, in the Center of Europe. 
  (Please see Chapter 2). We have also reasoned that where it says that Paul spoke 
  to the people in the Hebrew language (Acts 21:40), that he was speaking a European 
  dialect to European Jews who had fallen out over the centuries into the East. 
  Many of these, while speaking now in the greater parts of that world in either 
  Greek or Aramaic (which had become a kind of ancient Yiddish), would have also 
  retained their original Gaelic-like tongue. (The language that we associate 
  with Hebrew today was not spoken in those times, until its purely written and 
  liturgical forms were forced out of the cryptic Hebrew texts and made to sound 
  as it does today)...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To write concerning the Antiquities 
    of the Jews, who they were (originally) and how they revolted from the Egyptians, 
    and what country they travelled over, and what countries they seized upon 
    afterward, and how they were removed out of them, I think this not to be a 
    fit opportunity, and, on other accounts, also superfluous; and this because 
    many Jews before me have composed the histories of our ancestors very exactly; 
    as have some of the Greeks done it also, and have translated our histories 
    into their own tongue, and have not much mistaken the truth in their own histories. 
    But then, where the writers of these affairs and our prophets leave off, thence 
    shall I take my rise and begin my history.&quot;</font> Josephus' Preface 
    to The War of the Jews 6. Translated by William Whiston.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The only ones who are not familiar with what was then a very 
  normal state of Jewish affairs are those of us here at this end of the age who 
  are left with the accounts. Yet who in those times even knew that such other 
  religious accounts of those times, such as the Gospels and the Book of Acts, 
  were being composed? The Jews certainly didn't, until a hundred years or more 
  later when the first copies of them began to appear, and the common recollection 
  was already dimmed, and all things were in a state of flux? Who could dispute 
  such accounts? (What are we disputing here? Who? What? What Jesus? When? Where?) 
  Some did, but to what effect? And besides, who outside of this Circle of now-Christian 
  adepts, Essenes and Nazarites, could interpret these accounts? They were religious 
  documents (not historical documents but supra-historical), and there meanings 
  were <i>(purposefully and hermetically) </i>sealed.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The gradual reduction of 
    almost the whole of the known world to the political power of Rome had brought 
    about new possibilities of knowledge. Old barriers, such as State frontiers, 
    disappeared, and the whole world becoming one State, its different cultures 
    and its myriad religions began to interact and to fuse as never before. Everywhere 
    men were now in a position to study religions and compare the differences 
    of rite and legend and the elements all had in common. Soon the chief divinities 
    of one heathen system began to appear in the Olympus of another system, and 
    their legends to be similarly transferred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new religion of Christ Our 
    Lord, from the moment it moved outside of the Jewish 'milieu' in which it 
    was first preached, was thus immediately brought up against the influence 
    of worldwide religious activities. In every city there were philosophical 
    mystics and moral teachers ready, with their host of disciples and adepts, 
    to see affinities between their own beliefs and the teaching of the new arrival. 
    Moreover, once the Church began to make converts from this class it was but 
    natural that these would be attracted to the task of converting their former 
    associates, and that they would be endeavored to present Christianity to them 
    in the only language in which it could be understood, i.e. through an adaptation 
    of the terminology of their own philiosophico-religious beliefs.&quot; </font>A 
    Popular History of the Catholic Church, by Philip Hughes, p.4<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul, in his own travels, was eventually delivered to the Roman 
  governors, one of whom also says: <i>But if it be a question of words and names, 
  and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters</i> (Acts 
  18:15), and another, Agrippa, who tells Paul: <i>Almost thou persuadest me to 
  be a Christian.</i> (Acts 26:19-29). These governors had jurisdiction over the 
  affairs of all the Jews in that area of the world. Did their jurisdiction, and 
  that of their predecessors, the Herods, extend into Europe? Quite so. We can 
  find Herod I commanding a fleet of ships on the Black Sea in support of Rome 
  at the Bosporus. And in volume VIII of the <i>Ante Nicean Fathers</i>, Moses 
  of Chorene has him sending an army of Thracians and Germans against one Agbar. 
  (And then it must not be forgotten that the Herod of the Gospels is also an 
  apocryphal figure, as it is written: <i>Beware the leaven of Herod</i>...Mark 
  8:15)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We also learn that the office of Tetrarch, which the Herods 
  occupied, was also a Celtic institution which the Celts brought with them when 
  they (these &quot;Jews&quot;), fell out of Europe and crossed into Asia in the 
  centuries before the time of Christ:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Each of these tribes now 
    settled in Anatolia took over its own province, as Strabo says: 'The Trocmians 
    were in the eastern part of Galatia, the Tolistoagii in the western part, 
    the Tectosages between them.' For administrative purposes each of these provinces 
    were divided into four; each division under a leader who Strabo called 'tetrarch,' 
    to whom a judge, military governor, and two lesser commanders would be attached.&quot;</font> 
    The Celts, The People Who Came Out of Darkness, By Gerhard Herm, p.42</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Strabo has no idea, of course, that he is dealing in part here 
  with Jewish History, but these Celts will be among those to whom Paul will later 
  address his Letter to the Galatians--concerning matters that not only affected 
  the collective well-being of Israel in those times, but, more importantly, that 
  have to do with the whole Zionist state of affairs in our own. In all events, 
  if Paul had indeed come to that city in Palestine to offer a <i>morning sacrifice</i> 
  (Acts 21:13), Josephus makes no mention of it in his accounts. Paul appealed 
  to Caesar and was sent to Rome to make his offering there. His mission was to 
  the Gentile world.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is also likely that James and the elders never appeared 
  there either (at least not in terms of the Gospel narratives), even though some 
  of the Apostles did return to the East after the persecutions and the martyrdom 
  of Stephen (Acts 11:19 to 12:2)--but officially no further, we reason, than 
  Antioch, as it was written of that city made of Stones in the East:<i> Ye shall 
  henceforth return no more that way</i>. (Deut.17:14-16). Josephus, however, 
  seems to place the elders in that city, and leaves us a record of the execution 
  of James, <i>the brother of the Lord, </i>Antiquities XX.9.1 (not James, the 
  brother of John, who was martyred years earlier). And as James was among those 
  who greeted Paul at Jerusalem (Acts 21:17,18), there are two possibilities. 
  Either the saints did descend to that city in order to fulfill certain prophecies 
  and precepts of the Law, or we have another instance of geographical word play, 
  of which New Testament narratives are replete.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><img src="../UsedImages/pg186.gif" width="708" height="498"></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><b>For here we have no continuing City, but we seek one to 
    come...Hebrews 13:14; Matthew 24:7-22.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">As far as these Essenes were concerned, and afterwards for 
  Paul (or &quot;Elisha&quot;), wherever the elders were, that is where the City 
  was. (Hebrews 12:22,23; Heb.13:14). Thus for them the Eastern point of these 
  mysteries laid somewhere near Mount IDA (IuDeA), in the area of those Seven 
  Cities of Asia: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and 
  Laodicea. (Revelation 1:4; 11). But in any case, no matter where any of these 
  events occurred, Paul could still say: &quot;...<i>yet brought up in THIS CITY 
  at the feet of Gamaliel</i>. (Acts 22:1-3). His view of <i>THIS CITY </i>also 
  came to span the horizon from East to West. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A. E. Waite, in his work entitled <i>The Holy Kabbalah A Study 
  of the Secret Tradition in Israel as unfolded by the Sons of the Doctrine for 
  the Benefit and Consolation of the Elect dispersed through the Lands and Ages 
  of the Greater Exile</i>, leaves us a Talmudic account of (the great second 
  century) Rabbi Judah the Prince which will also shift our attention to that 
  hidden place in Central Europe. Speaking of the centuries-long composition of 
  Mishna-Torah (the Talmud), he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is claimed that this source 
    goes back to the period of Esdras, but the most that can be admitted is that 
    the materials embodied in the literature (the Talmud) are older than their 
    earliest collected forms. These materials were certain MISHNAYOTH, a term 
    signifying repetitions--namely, notes of academic teachings, which received 
    many subsequent additions. Prior to the year 220, A.D., a considerable portion 
    of these was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince, by whom they were methodised 
    carefully, short comments of his own being also added occasionally...&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And then Waite adds a footnote which says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(He was the third patriarch of 
    the Western Jews, and a legend says that, HAVING CONVERTED THE EMPEROR MARCUS 
    AURELIUS, he compiled the Mishna at the command of that Prince). p.27.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It will be remembered that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius is more 
  associated with Vindabona than he is with Rome (think of the movie <i>The Gladiator)</i>, 
  and it was in that city-above that emperor wrote his own famous <i>Analects</i>. 
  We have also learned in <i>Avot (The Sayings of the Fathers)</i>, that Gamaliel 
  was a teacher of those who inhabited both &quot;the Upper Galilee and the Lower&quot;, 
  and of those who dwelt everywhere among the dispersed, in the &quot;Upper South, 
  and the Lower South.&quot; The Nag Hammadi Texts also speak of a certain Gamaliel, 
  an angel or a spirit of some Kabbalistic proportions who seems to overshadow 
  our Gamaliel of Talmudic fame. (We think they are the same)...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Again, what Galilee is the Gospel referring to? Certainly not 
  that barren drift of land in the Middle East, but the Galilee of the Nations,

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> But how are we to get Paul up in Central Europe (the &quot;Upper

  persecution of the Church? Paul himself provides the clue when he says: <i>I 
  am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia</i> (Acts 
  21:39,40), which does not mean, as we readily assume, that he is from anywhere 
  in the East at all. Employing the same narrative methods as we have from the 
  beginning of this work we read from <i>The Histories of Herodotus</i>:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">History does not refute it, but rather, through its own glaring 
  silence on the matter, supports it. Likewise, of the events of Acts, chapters 
  1 to 7, which are supposed to be happening in that city in the East, Josephus, 
  again, makes no mention--and this purposefully, because they did not happen 
  there. He picks up the story at Acts 11 and 12, after the Church finds its way 
  back into the East after the persecutions suffered at the hands of the Jewish-Druid 
  priests of Central Europe. It was then that Herod slew James, the brother of 
  John, with the sword. (Acts 12:1,2). These adepts in the Mystery of Christ all 
  considered themselves to be the Morning Sacrifice, and so gave their lives as 
  God required them. (See Exodus 29:37-46).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Josephus gives us another cryptic hint as to his knowledge 
  of the dimensions of this mystery, and of the fact that the central doctrines 
  of the early Church were emanating now out of Europe rather than the East, in 
  his treatment of the story of Archelaus, the ethnarch of Judaea, and his wife, 
  Glaphyra, who were exiled by Caesar to the city of Vienna in Gaul (France). 
  See how he carefully blends the ideas contained in Hosea, chapter 2, Ezekiel 
  16, and Jeremiah 31:31-33, into his narrative:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But in the tenth year of 
    Archelaus's government, both his brethren and the principle men of Judea and 
    Samaria, not being able to bear his barbarous and tyrannical usage of them, 
    accused him before Caesar, which obliged him to behave himself with moderation 
    among them...And when he was come to Rome, to Caesar, upon hearing what certain 
    accusers of his had to say...banished him, and appointed Vienna, a city of 
    Gaul, to be his habitation...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now before Archelaus was gone up 
    to Rome...he related this dream to his friends: THAT HE SAW EARS OF CORN, 
    IN NUMBER TEN, FULL OF WHEAT, PERFECTLY RIPE; which ears it seemed to him 
    were devoured by Oxen. And when he was awake, because the vision seemed of 
    great importance to him, he sent for the diviners, whose study was employed 
    about dreams. And while some were of one opinion, and some of another, Simon 
    a man of the sect of Essenes, desired to speak his mind freely, AND SAID THAT 
    THE VISION DENOTED A CHANGE OF AFFAIRS, AND THAT NOT FOR THE BETTER </font>(for 
    the old order of things)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; that oxen, 
    because that animal takes uneasy pains in his labours</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,

    and that the ears of corn being ten, determined the like number of years, 
    because an ear of corn grows in one year; and that the time of Archelaus's

<p><font size="+1">History clearly reveals that there were two churches in those 
  first several centuries; the first, which we have also followed into Europe, 
  as well as other places, and identified with an original <a href="SideLinks/EarlyCelticChurch.htm">Celtic 
  Church</a> (the direct result of the Apostles' first missionary efforts, filling 
  up all those stone circles with their now-Christian presence), and the emerging 
  World-church which also came up in time, accompanied, however, by a powerful 
  Roman presence with which it was now in league. Under the pretext of driving 
  pagan-Druid influence out of its newly acquired domains, both in Britain and 
  on the continent, it also, slowly but methodically, and often-times violently, 
  drove the first and true Church (which it could not distinguish from other Druids, 
  and which likewise would not accede to its accords) into near oblivion as well. 
  This first Druidic branch of the Church had, by necessity, to slide back into 
  the mist as it was, with the long-fabled Tuatha de Danaan before them, for the 
  very simple reason that it was wholly pacifistic in nature, and thus it could 
  not stand up for very long before the militaristic doctrines of the Romans, 
  and then later before the Gothic onslaught. It was simply overwhelmed by the 
  force of history (as was intended by God). Nevertheless, its risidual influences 
  were to be found everywhere throughout the continent and beyond after that, 
  and its written records were preserved as well. (The primary Gospels being a 
  chief example, along with the wealth of other gnostic texts that followed them). 
  Everyone of these early adepts carried with them the &quot;Stigmata,&quot; or 
  the marks of their mystical connection to the Mystery of Christ. And everyone 
  of them stood ready to be persecuted for the faith (which is, of course, the

<p><font size="+1">The following account of James, and the necessary questions 
  it raises, is taken from G.R.S. Mead's <i>Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.</i></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;Eusubius tells us 
    that in his day 'the most accurate account' of James was to be found in the 
    fifth book of the Commentaries of Hegesippus, who, he says, 'flourished nearest 
    to the days of the Apostles'; modern scholarship, however, assigns the date 
    of Hegesippus's 'Memoirs' to about 180 A.D.. Eusubius then proceeds to quote 
    from Hegesippus the story of the martyrdom of James, the setting and the tone 
    of which is very Jewish. The most interesting part of the story, however, 
    is the description of James himself, where we read:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">'He was holy from his 
    mother's womb, drank no wine or strong drink, nor ate animal food; no razor 
    came upon his head; he neither oiled himself nor used the bath; HE ALONE WAS 
    PERMITTED TO ENTER THE HOLY PLACES, for he never wore wool, but always linen. 
    AND HE USED TO GO ALONE IN THE TEMPLE, and was found on his knees, interceding 
    for the people, so that his knees grew hard like a camel's because of his 
    kneeling in prayer before God, begging forgiveness for the people. Indeed, 
    on account of his exceeding great righteousness he was called &quot;the Righteous&quot; 
    and &quot;Olbias&quot; which means in Greek &quot;defense of the people&quot; 
    and righteousness.'</font></p>

    of a rigid ascetic, a Chassid, an Essene, a Therapeut, a Nazir, </font><font size="3">(a

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It is, of course, impossible

<p><font size="+1">The early Church was an old Oracle dressed in new garments 
  as it were, but clearly an upstart in the minds of those who had a religious, 
  social, political, or commercial stake in the old status-quo. As they came back 
  up into Europe (the Holy Place), and as some of them began to gather out of 
  the various religious traditions of their time those things that would go to 
  make for a unified view of Divine Reality, they appeared to others as troublemakers 
  plain and simple--a secret religious (radical) cult--based in (experimental) 
  &quot;communistic&quot; principles mind you. To the establishment it was as 
  if they were trying to foster a new kind of anarchy and confusion in the world. 
  And they no doubt appeared to many to be in league somehow with those Jews who 
  were attempting to cast off the yoke of Rome in the East. This first Church 
  had to tread carefully, as well as boldly, through the political currents of 
  their times. Their view of the world, although it took into account the real-politik 
  of the age, transcended the affairs of that world itself. Their's was the worldview 
  of the true Bodhisatvas. Having annihilated their own affections for the things 
  of that age through the mystery of the Cross (through the teachings of the Great 
  Universal Mandala into which they had become initiated), they had come alive 
  to the hidden meanings of things that overshadowed and permeated the whole of 
  their reality--a reality, they understood, that would not reveal itself again 
  until the last days. (This mystery was contained in the overshadowing presence 
  of the Holy Ghost). And because this first Church was not interested in coming 
  to political power in its own time, or at any time throughout the whole period 
  of the coming <i>Age of Wickedness</i> as these Essenes called it, it left the 
  world at large to what it could make of Paul's teachings (which were also wholly 
  Kabbalistic in form, Vedic as well as Buddhist in nature, but also concealed), 
  and virtually disappeared. Among the things that these adepts took with them 
  was the mystery of the Omphalos, or the Navel Stone of the World-mystery, and 
  the fact that this place was situated in the center of Europe and not in Palestine:</font></p>

  these oracles once pointed, we must take notice of those whom history knows 
  as the Jewish and Christian Sibyllines. These prophetesses are an essential 
  link between the ancient world of the Divine Mother and the mysteries of the 
  &quot;Son.&quot; According to the Prologue to the Sibylline Oracles in <i>The 
  Old Testament Pseudepigrapha </i>they were &quot;ten&quot; in number. The first 
  of them was of Chaldean origin, &quot;a daughter of Noah&quot; it was said. 
  (Recall that MacDari attributes the word &quot;Chaldea&quot; to an old Celtic

    attested phenomenon in the ancient world. They are found in Greek HEXameters.

    Asiatic and their type of prophecy is widely assumed to have come to Greece 
    from the East...although there is no clear evidence to support or refute this 
    view...The Sibyl is always depicted as an aged woman uttering ecstatic prophecies. 
    Ovid tells us that she was granted by Apollo that she might live as many years 
    as there were grains of sand on the seashore. </font>(See Genesis 22:17)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">... 
    According to Heracleides Ponticus (c. 360-325 B.C.) the Sibyl was older than 
    Orpheus. If any historical prophetess ever underlay the figure of the Sibyl, 
    she was already lost in the mists of legend by the fifth century. According 
    to Heraclitus she &quot;reaches through thousands of years&quot; with her

    OMPHALOS OF CHRISTIANITY</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The esoteric cosmological 
    symbolism of the early Christian gnosis was based upon the inherited teachings 
    of the earlier Greek theological science. In the same way that Apollo possessed 
    his omphalos stone at Delphi, it was imperative that the New Song of the Solar 
    Logos be built upon an appropriate foundation. Thus in the words of Jesus, 
    'I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock (petra) I will build 
    my Church.' The Greek word Peter is literally (petros) rock, and elsewhere 
    Jesus gives Simon the name of 'Cephas' <img src="../UsedImages/Cephas.gif" width="56" height="14">, 
    based on the Aramaic word for rock: 'Thou art Simon, the son of John, thou 
    shalt be called Cephas (which is interpreted Peter).&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The name Cephas was not chosen 
    at random for, by gamatria, it amounts to 729, and represents the CUBIC foundation 
    stone facing. This number was most important to Plato, and the Pythagoreans; 
    not only is it a Cube (9 X 9 X 9), but it is also a Square (27 X 27), and 
    is associated with the Solar year.</font></p>

    This shape may be perceived by the pure in heart, although God's shape does 
    not exist in three-dimensional space. Rather the form of God underlies the 
    structure of three-dimensional space. God exists at the center of and heart 
    of the universe and His form is that of the &quot;Cube&quot; or three-dimensional 
    coordinate system: from His form radiates the six directions of space while 
    He contains within the Seventh point of rest. 'He is, as it were, in the center

    better than the tyrant. Concerning the number 729, Socrates remarks that it 
    is 'a number which is closely concerned with human life, if human life is 
    concerned with days and nights and months and years.' This is proven correct

<p><font size="+1">Popular Church history would have the Eastern and Roman orders 
  emerging in form from the Jewish Temple in the East after the time of Christ, 
  when in reality they emerged, or descended from the Jewish-Druidical order of 
  priests of Europe--but not directly. (Please understand these things in the 
  chapters devoted to the Holy Name and the name of Jesus). The Papacy has more 
  to do with the Roman empire and the reign of Caesar in the world than it has 
  with the reign of Christ. It is part of the political and religious structure 
  of the age that is passing, and cannot inherit any part of the age to come. 
  We follow this realization, and trace this pathway from the High Druids Priests 
  of Europe (Simeon the Just was the last well-noted of these High Priests), but 
  through the reign of Caesar first, before it leads to the institution of the 
  Papacy. We follow it from even before the time of Julius Caesar himself, through 
  the title that was bestowed upon him after his return from the North--the title 
  of &quot;Pontifix Maximus,&quot; the chief priest-king of the state mysteries...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;PONTIFEX...The title given 
    by the ancient Romans to members of one of the two celebrated religious colleges, 
    the other being known as the College of Augurs. Originally there were Five 
    pontiffs of this order of priests, the president being styled Pontifix Maximus, 
    but the number was afterward increased to nine and still later to 15. The 
    pontiffs were not charged with conducting sacrifices, nor were they obliged 
    to worship any particular divinity, but they had general control of the official 
    religion, and their head was the highest religious authority in the state, 
    thus being neither subject to the people or the senate. Only patricians were 
    eligible to membership in the Pontifex until 300 B.C., when the number was 
    increased to nine under the Ogulnian law, and four of the Pontiffs were selected 
    from the plebians...In 81 B.C. the number was increased to 15 by Sulla, and 
    Julius Caesar added himself shortly after as the 16th, holding the position 
    of Pontifex Maximus. With the beginning of the empire, the highest dignity 
    was bestowed upon the emperor and the title passed in succession to the ruling 
    sovereign. In the time of Theodosius the title became equivalent to Pope, 
    and it is now one of the designations of the head of the Roman Catholic Church.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The great historical heresy of the Roman church will not simply 
  lie in the fact that it appropriated this title to itself after the fall of 
  the Western empire, but in the fact that--through its league, or marriage as 
  it was, with the cult of the Roman emperors--it acquired the exclusive right 
  to this title by both insistence and force, proving then, and for all future 
  times that it had no deep connection, or understanding of the teachings of Christ. 
  <i>They went out from us, </i>wrote John, <i>but they were not of us. For if 
  they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us...</i>(1 John 
  2:19). In its ongoing complicity with the powers of this age the emerging World-church 
  could do nothing but increase the state of transgression it was already in. 
  The succeeding popes and emperors (seeing the world through their own eyes, 
  and not those of the Spirit), naturally came to see themselves as agents of 
  good, that is, of righteous order in the world, and all who opposed them as 
  evil; and themselves as particularly raised up by God in the world to destroy 
  this evil (and even each other at times). In so doing the World-church became 
  the increasing force for evil in the world, and a full player in all of the 
  disorder and confusion that grips the world today. (The true Church, mind you, 
  has always been a <i>remnant</i> and a <i>stranger</i> in the midst of all this 
  disorder...and now even more so here in America).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Ralph Woodrow (who, like many others who have studied the history 
  of the Catholic church with a more-than-critical eye--as every thinking Christian 
  should) says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But how could one man be 
    at the same time both the head of the Church and still be Pontifix Maximus, 
    the head of the pagan mysteries? In an attempt to cover this discrepancy church 
    leaders have sought for similarities between the two religions...One striking 
    similarity that was found was this: The Supreme Pontiff of paganism bore the 
    chaldean title, 'peter,' or 'interpreter--the interpreter of the mysteries.' 
    Here then was an opportunity for the compromising leaders of that time to 
    &quot;Christianize&quot; the pagan office of Pontifix Maximus, the office 
    of the Bishop of Rome...by associating the 'Peter' or 'Grand Interpreter of 
    Rome' with Peter the Apostle...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this presented its problems 
    </font>(Woodrow goes on to say)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...In 
    order to connect the Apostle Peter with this pagan office...it was necessary 
    to teach that the Apostle Peter had actually gone to Rome. </font>Babylon 
    Mystery Religion, pp.80-83<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Woodrow runs against tradition when he says that Peter had 
  never been to Rome. William Stuart McBirnie, in his <i>Search For the Twelve 
  Apostles </i>cites evidence for Peter's travels in the East and throughout Europe, 
  and of his presence in Rome he says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The common tradition that 
    St. Peter founded the church at Rome is unverifiable. Paul could hardly have 
    named so many Roman Christians in the last chapter of Romans if there had 
    not been churches there long before any possible visit of St. Peter. Danielou 
    observes however:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Was Paul's the only mission to 
    the West? The Acts tell us in 43, after the death of James, Peter left Jerusalem 
    &quot;for another place&quot; (Acts 12:17). He is lost from sight until 49, 
    when we find him at the Council of Jerusalem. No canonical text has anything 
    to say about his missionary activities during this time. But Eusubius (270-340 
    A.D.) says that he came to Rome about 44, at the beginning of Claudius's reign.'&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">McBirnie cites and then dismisses what others say is a veiled 
  reference to Rome in the term Babylon. (1Peter 5:13). Though Peter almost certainly 
  traveled to the &quot;circumcision&quot; at Babylon, we accept the double usage 
  seeing how the mysteries of Babylon had to pass through Rome on their way here 
  to the West. It is almost also certain that he appeared in Britain to help establish 
  the church there, along with a Joseph of Arimithea and the other adepts in the 
  Christian mysteries. And it is even possible that he sailed away to the farthest 
  West itself as the prophet Ezekiel did, and as Paul also did during his wanderings 
  in &quot;Arabia.&quot; (The connections between the two continents and their 
  common religious traditions are preserved everywhere in the histories and the 
  oral teachings of Indigenous American peoples, in the stories of the &quot;Feathered 
  Serpent, as well as in the words of the Psalms themselves...Psalm 19:1-6)...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have sufficient evidence

    time. </font>(Collier mentions some resonings of Eusebius, then continues)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The 
    next authority shall be that of Theodoret, who amongst the nations converted 
    by the Apostles, expressly mentions Britain. Theodoret's testimony is confirmed 
    by St. Jerome in his commentary upon Amos, where he tells us that St. Paul 
    having been in Spain sailed from one ocean to another; that he imitated the 
    course of the Sun of Righteousness, of whom it is said, His going forth is 
    from one end of heaven unto the other; and that his progress reached as far 
    as the extremity of the earth.&quot; </font>The Ecclesiastical History of

<p><font size="+1"> Clement, in his <i>Recognitions </i>and in his <i>Homilies</i> 
  has our Simon Peter (the true Interpreter) engaged in a series of disputes with 
  that other Simon (Acts 8:9-24), which carried him from one place in the empire 
  to another, and which, Clement says, carried him to Rome as well, because the 
  other Simon did not only arrive there himself but completed his life there. 
  And this episode provides us with another set of reflections, or mirror images--in 
  this case the spirit of true Gnosticism against that form of worldly &quot;gnosticism&quot; 
  that will eventually result in the formation of the great World-church itself. 
  Not that Simon Magus was personally responsible for the creation of the Roman 
  Catholic Church, but that in the figure of this Simon is embodied the roots 
  and the branches of that form of religious heresy that will grow up in so many 
  others as well to become the Great Roman Church as we know it today. </font></p>

  in history, and particularly the Western state of mind that we have fallen into--of 
  which it is written that &quot;the gates of this (Western) realm shall not prevail 
  against the Nation-church.&quot; Likewise it should be pointed out what happens 
  to a Rock when it is dropped in the water, as the mysteries of Israel were in 
  the midst of the Nations. It sinks to the bottom. So the rock called Peter, 
  after it was committed to that place named Beauty in the center of the Oracle, 
  also sank down, down, down, until it arrived at this same place on the Tree 
  of Life named Foundation. As it went it passed clean over the head, or rather, 
  over the mind of Rome:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Legend, and therefore the sacred oracles, already had it that 
  old Chronus (the mystery of Time) had fled away from Olympus to a place named 
  Italy after the old order changed hands. And with him came the idea of an Eternal 
  City set upon Seven hills (Cibola)...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Western <i>Italia</i>, not the European.</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> But we have already seen in a previous chapter that the Olympus 
  from which Chronus fled lay beyond that mountain in Greece, in the center of 
  Europe, and that the &quot;Italy&quot; towards which the god fled, the same 
  toward which Aeneas's ships were originally pointed, actually lay far off at 
  the Western ends of the earth... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus we learned that it was to Eden that Chronus fled, to await 
  the day when the great Circle would be completed, in the fulness of time itself. 
  And we learn from the Scriptures that within the structure of this myth (or 
  rather this reality) was a belief older than the Gilgamesh epic that one should 
  be born in this city, a priest-king (or a priest and a king...Genesis 3:15), 
  who would grow up in time to correctly interpret the mysteries, and rule the 
  world. Thus appeared the spirits of the many antichrists in the world, each 
  imagining in their turn that they were the one: all the Pharaohs, the Assyrians, 
  the kings of Babylon, Haman (of the Persian epic), Alexander, all the Caesars, 
  the Holy Roman emperors and Napoleon--and eventually the Presidents of the United 
  States of America. After all, Ronald Reagan not too many years ago laid claim 
  to the myth for America as well. And yes, the Papacy. (Anyone who--in the name 
  of Christ, and in the name of these mysteries--consorts with the nation-states 
  in their drive to power, and anyone who partakes in anyway, or supports, or 
  rationalizes in anyway, the taking of human life and the forceful suppression 
  of knowledge and oppression of other peoples and nations, is an antichrist (and 
  now they are all caught). In the greatest sense, it is the seat of Power itself 
  which makes of anyone who occupies it an antichrist).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Virgil in the meantime has Aeneas not merely fleeing the destruction 
  of Troy, but also setting out on a sea-journey to the ends of the earth (to 
  a land named Hesperia), and he has Aeneas's son, Ascanius, or Iu'lus, setting 
  out with him. Virgil will say that this scion of the ancients, this son of Rome, 
  this son of Troy, this son of the Danaans (the children of Israel), this son 
  of God, is none other than Julius Caesar himself:</font></p>

    son, Aeneas, high as heaven's stars. My will is still the same; I have not 
    changed. Your son (I now speak out--I know this anxiousness is gnawing at 
    you; I UNROLL THE SECRET SCROLLS OF FATE, AWAKE ITS DISTANT PAGES) will wage 
    tremendous war in Italy and crush ferocious nations, and establish a way of 
    life and walls for his own people--until the time of his Third summer as the 
    king of Latium, until he has passed Three winters since he overcame the Latins. 
    But then the boy Ascanius, who is now carrying Iu'lus as his surname (while 
    the state of Ilium held fast, he still was known as Iu'lus), with his rule 
    shall fill the Wheeling Months of THIRTY mighty years. He shall remove his 
    kingdom from Lavinium and, powerful, build Alba Longa's walls. For full three

<p><font size="+1">As 'the Fates&quot; would have it, and according to the epic 
  Roman myth that Virgil later spun around him, Julius Caesar did return from 
  &quot;the Woods of Ida&quot; (IuDeA in the north). Add to that the title of 
  Pontifix Maximus, and we begin to sense something of the mystique with which 
  the later Roman pontiffs clothed themselves in their own ascent to ecclesastical 
  and political power after the fall of the Western empire. This emerging <i>Catholic</i> 
  order not only adopted the garments and apparel of the prelates of the Roman 
  government, but also the vestments of the Druid priesthood, which it also conscripted 
  from the North, an inevitability also alluded to by Paul in Acts 20:25-33. But 
  then, when this Roman order did not only align itself with the political powers 
  of the age (in violation of all the precepts of Christ), and as it became a 
  political and &quot;religious&quot; power in its own right, it began to fulfill 
  a realm of prophecy that it didn't even know existed. It is discovered in the 
  structure of what some have recognized as &quot;the mystery&quot; of the Hebrew 
  Kings. And it leads to the words which say: <i>And the judgment was set and 
  the books were opened. </i>(Daniel 7:10; <i> </i>Revelation 20:12; 13:8).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We will treat this Mystery of the Hebrew Kings, and the meaning 
  of the sequence and the dates of their individual reigns, in the chapter on 
  The Nature and the Mark of the Beast. It is the key to opening the books of 
  the Prophets in our times. Suffice it to say here that next to the name of each 
  Hebrew king are two sets of dates, one marked B.C. and the other A.D.. The first 
  set of dates points to the times that characterized the hidden life of Israel 
  in those centuries before Christ; the second set reveals the things that began 
  to unfold again out of books of the prophets in our own times. The first narratives 
  were composed in types and images, and in the embodying of certain epic and 
  spiritual principles in such figures as Saul, D.V.D, and Solomon. The second 
  narrative, or rather the second reading of these same texts opens the mind to 
  the Presence of God in the affairs of our own times. (The 25th chapter of Jeremiah, 
  for instance, is a description, not of ancient times but of the entire 20th 
  century, and the United States of America is the <i>Chaldeans</i> of Habakkuk, 
  chapter 1)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As such we will open up the Books of Samuel at the turn of 
  the 15th and 16th centuries, and find the whole period of the Inquisitions and 
  the Reformation described in those conflicts that were waged there between Israel 
  and the Philistines. As in more hoary times, when the children of Adam mingled 
  themselves with other states of mind, and brought forth &quot;giants&quot; (Genesis 
  6), (which means that they brought forth children whose perceptions of the world 
  were confused, and who, in turn, grew up to govern the thinking of &quot;large&quot; 
  amounts of other people in the earth), so the Giant, Goliath, represents the 
  entire hierarchy and collective spirit of this great World-church. This Giant 
  was reborn in the events of this age, and grew to power when church prelates 
  began to familiarize themselves with the vacant seats of Roman senators, sitting 
  in them contrary to the law which said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, 
    and do them: that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein spue you not 
    out.</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>AND YE SHALL NOT WALK IN THE MANNER OF THE NATIONS WHICH 
    I CAST OUT BEFORE YOU</i></font><i><font size="+1">: for they committed these 
    things, and therefore I abhorred them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Leviticus 
    20:21-23).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And in coveting these seats of power, indeed the very seat 
  of the Roman emperor itself, they became to the true Nation-Church what the 
  Philistines were to ancient Israel: an opposing force and their spiritual oppressors.</font></p>

  practically all of Judaeo-Christendom was under its sway (except those who were 
  then under the sway of Goliath's brother--the Eastern church and its own peculiar 
  nationalist and imperial tendencies). To understand it better we must return 
  to the first centuries of the Christian era, and to those words that were beginning 
  to take effect in the life of the Church. For just as these latter times have 
  unfolded according to the visions of the Prophets, so the early Church entered 
  Europe (just as Israel did in ancient times), fulfilling the hidden precepts 
  and requirements of the Law of Moses and the prophetic import of the books of 
  Joshua and Judges:</font></p>

  who were trying to cast off the oppressive yoke of Rome. Thus:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">When the people came into the camp the elders of Israel 
    said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us this day before the Philistines? 
    </font></i><font size="+1"><i>LET US FETCH THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</i> <font size="3">(The 
    Mysteries)</font> <i>OUT OF SHILOH UNTO US</i></font><i><font size="+1">. 
    It may save us out of the hands of our enemies.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">So all the people went to Shiloh </font></i><font size="3">(which 
    is a state of mind, not a place)</font><i><font size="+1"> that they might 
    bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord which dwellest between the Cherubims,</font></i><font size="+1"> 
    <font size="3">(between the Male and Female principles, but in neither of 
    them exclusively...in other words, along the Central Pillar of the Tree of 
    Life)</font></font><font size="3"><i>...</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">See also: that when the people fetched the Ark, Eli's sons, 
  Hophni and Phinahas, were among them. (1 Samuel 4:4; 2:12). This means that 
  the reformers were not all pure themselves, and that they did not understand 
  the depths of the mysteries themselves, or the full meaning of those things 
  that were unfolding around them. For the father of these two, Eli--who represented 
  the church's last connection to the old ways and the forgotten things--was himself 
  of old age. <i>And his eyes were dim, and he could not see.</i> (1 Sam. 4:15). 
  And besides, the sons of Eli were wicked also. There was wickedness and worldliness 
  in both camps. (1 Sam.2:12-17; 27-36; 3:11-14; 2 Timothy 4:3). Nevertheless:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">When the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the 
    camp,</font></i><font size="+1"> <i>ALL ISRAEL SHOUTED WITH GREAT JOY, SO 
    THAT THE EARTH RANG AGAIN</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, 
    they said, what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? 
    And they understood </font></i><font size="3">(that the people were printing 
    tracts and bibles, and preaching, and throwing off the shackles of spiritual 
    oppression).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is 
    come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! For there hath not been such 
    a thing heretofore.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hands of these 
    mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues 
    in the wilderness...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Samuel 4:5-8).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Philistines girded themselves for the battle, issuing encyclicals 
  and bulls, and sending out ambassadors, saying:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, 
    that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been unto you: quit 
    yourselves like men, and fight.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and 
    they fled every man to his tent: </font></i><font size="+1"><i>AND THERE WAS 
    A GREAT SLAUGHTER</i></font><i><font size="+1">: for there fell of Israel 
    Thirty thousand footmen/</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>AND THE ARK OF GOD WAS TAKEN</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Sam.4:9-11).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But who may hold the word of God in captivity for long?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">When the Philistines took the Ark of God, they brought 
    it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon... </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when they arose early in the morning, behold, Dagon 
    was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; </font></i><font size="+1"><i>and 
    THE HEAD OF DAGON</i>, <i>AND BOTH PALMS OF HIS HANDS were cut off upon the 
    threshold</i></font><i><font size="+1">; only the stump of him was left to 
    them...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Sam.5:2,4)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Dagon was said to have been a Fish-god, but what is it but 
  another, more ancient manifestation of the Christ-mystery. The Crucifix, which 
  is the central object of worship in the Roman church, must be contemplated as 
  one contemplates a Mandala for all of its meanings. One must spend long hours 
  before it, in solitude, penetrating its secrets, being penetrated by them, by 
  the dim flickering lights, and by the smell of incense and candle. One must 
  slowly become what they contemplate. And if allowed into the Mystery one might 
  then discover how the two Palms of this image of Christ are connected to those 
  places on the Oracle where both the names of John the Baptist and Paul are found; 
  and that the Head, or the Mind of Christ, is connected on the central pillar 
  of the Oracle to the Mind of God (and therefore to all the mysteries of the 
  East). One might then see how the World-church has been cut off from these realizations; 
  indeed from the very gift of prophecy itself (not only then, but right into 
  our present time). Catholicism was rendered incapable of perceiving the past, 
  the present, or the future, because of all the graven images it created for 
  itself--again, in violation of the precepts of God:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Of course the Hebrew Scriptures are full of such literary images, 
  so the rules of circumspection must prevail. (See Exodus 23:13; Ephesians 5:15). 
  The intent of the commandment is not merely to dissuade us from worshipping, 
  or becoming fixated on the material order of things--the illusions of materiality--but 
  from attaching ourselves to any imperfect notions of God whatsoever, or to any 
  human images or personalities, doctrines, or philosophies, that even suggest 
  the possibility of there being more than One Force in the universe, or more 
  than One source from which both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; flows. 
  And it is to keep us from being in violation of the Universal Law of Correspondences. 
  According to this Law every created thing in the Universe is a mirror reflection 
  of some other reality, and contains within itself the meaning of something else. 
  The Sun is a reflection of a greater reality, as is the Moon and the Stars. 
  The various creatures of the natural realm, beasts, birds, and fish, are a reflection 
  in themselves of the various spirits and levels of consciousness that motivate 
  and govern human behavior. Studying the salient characteristics of the animal 
  creatures we live with, we realize how many groups of humans, as well as individuals 
  personalities in our time, possess these same characteristics. Some are gentle 
  and can be trusted, and some are strong yet do not hunt or kill others in order 
  to nourish themselves. (We notice that none of the creatures that are acceptable 
  upon God's altar are meat eaters or hunters). Others (many of the very personalities 
  who are revered among us) run in packs and are vicious (even if they seem otherwise 
  among their own kind); some are like lions, some are like bears, others are 
  self-reflexive and subtle like the serpent. Some are like vultures and other 
  birds of prey. Some are bottom feeders, some are like sharks. Thus the words: 
  <i>And the vilest men are exalted... </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Lord of hosts (the Angel of Divine Presence...Exodus 23:20-23; 
  24:9,10), whose image has been fixed in a purely male form upon millions of 
  graven crucifixes, is the very same who was literally put to death by the Roman 
  church itself, a million times. The Lord has been put to death in the millions 
  of individuals, both male and female alike, whom the Roman church has murdered 
  in inquisitions and wars of conquest over the centuries since the time of Christ. 
  And this same Lord--the same who has commanded us to make no image of Him--is 
  also the very one who has risen up in the totality of every human event and 
  in all the judgments of the 20th century because of it. Thus the commandment: 
  <i>Beware, you saw no image. </i>Lift up the mind and see it. The reference 
  to the hosts of heaven--which we are commanded not to worship--is not to those 
  stellar bodies that illuminate the night sky, but to their reflection in the 
  earth--to the powers and <a href="../UsedImages/pg168.gif">principalities</a> 
  that rule over the very present affairs of humankind, of which Paul speaks when 
  he says):</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Let no man (therefore) beguile you of your reward in a 
    voluntary humility (or submission) and worshipping of angels, intruding into 
    those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind...</font></i><font size="+1">(Colossians 
    2:18,19).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus with the word of God plaguing the land of Canaan <i>They

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Philistines were being smitten &quot;in their secret parts&quot; 
  (1 Sam.5:9). The whole life of the Roman church was being called into question, 
  its spiritual, political, and its military, as well as its sexual practices. 
  These are the &quot;emerods.&quot; The &quot;mice&quot; symbolize the small, 
  mostly unseen but constant attacks upon the seed of God's word--so that, if 
  released in the camp, by the time of the great Harvest in the last days, when 
  the Word of God should be sown once again in the hearts of men, the seed itself 
  would be diminished, or too corrupted, or gone. All that would be left would 
  be the World-church's faulty and unenlightened interpretation of it. (Or rather, 
  its own present non-interpretation of it. It is the same Non-Word which Pope 
  John Paul also imagined could carry the day at the time of his elevation). Did 
  the Philistines repent? No, they made &quot;images&quot; of their transgressions--an 
  &quot;image&quot; of repentance. Instead of surrendering to the Spirit of the 
  times they staged a counter-reformation, and satisfied themselves that they 
  had made all the necessary spiritual adjustments...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Philistines sent the Ark of God back to the children of 
  Israel. They had no choice. Knowledge was surpassing them. The Spirit, who <i>listeth 
  where She will</i>, was leaving them behind. The mysteries of the times were 
  unfolding everywhere around them; and the Word of God was being translated into 
  the languages of the people, and into the language of science, despite their 
  continued and violent attempts to supress it...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How do we connect these five ancient place-names with Rome, 
  Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria? First of all we realize 
  that the Old Testament narratives, while they have a certain historicity to 
  them, that is, while they were written upon the backdrop of certain historical 
  events, were penned in epic and allegorical form, and in Hebrew types and images. 
  The Philistines, for instance, are not a people that ever existed in the political 
  sense at all--at least not in Palestine. (Or at least not as they have been 
  &quot;literally&quot; described in the Bible. Certainly we can see that Goliath--like 
  Samson the Philistine killer before him--is a figure of the Hebrew literary 
  genius as well). The Philistine spirit, however, symbolized what were to the 
  ancient Hebrew scribes a very real and potent opposition to the truth--as real 
  to those in their times as the great World-church has been to the true Church 
  in this age. Like the Phoenician state of mind (and from the Hebrew point of 
  view no doubt identical to it), the doctrines of the &quot;Philistines&quot; 
  were very close to the teachings of Israel; so close, in so many ways--what 
  with all of its mysteries and rituals, its cult of Dionysus--that it posed the 
  most formidable threat of all to the traditions of Israel. And this because, 
  being the worldly heresy that is it was, all dressed up in the apparel of the 
  Truth, it allowed its adherents to continue in their worldly ways, and to fulfill 
  their natural drives and instincts for power (or to servitude), without forfeiting 
  the benefits of religion. The Philistine spirit just took what it could make 
  of the World-mysteries, and brought them to the people in a way that enhanced 
  their own power and the people's willing, and humble subservience to them, just 
  as the great World-church does today...(This is not to say...that true Christian 
  insight has not been born out of this great state of Darkness. The Catholic 
  church, like all the other major religious traditions in the earth (and despite 
  itself), has given birth to thousands upon thousands of &quot;true&quot; Christ-conscious 
  souls, many who are even able to solve the riddle...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Historians connect the Philistines with a group of Sea Peoples 
  who it is said colonized the Eastern Mediterranean shores in ancient times, 
  &quot;possibly from Crete.&quot; But even if we can find such a people there 
  it is certain that the place-names associated with them did not originate there 
  in the East, but rather came with them. The names themselves (which were later 
  associated with various places in Palestine), and their original meanings, remained 
  back in Europe, hidden in the writings and the literary methods of the Hebrew 
  scribes. It was later, after these things were neatly concealed from the eyes 
  of the world, that others came down to Palestine and said, &quot;this must be 
  that place, and that must be this place,&quot; and so assigned to various places 
  there names that never existed there before. The chief architects of this method 
  of &quot;scholarship by <i>fiat&quot; </i>in this age was Helena, the mother 
  of Constantine, and the priests that attended her in her pilgrimage to the Holy 
  Land:</font></p>

    those other thousands upon thousands who have fought and died over them)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">. 
    She built the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem, </font><font size="3">(of 
    course, she and those who followed in her scholarly footsteps had to first 
    decide where Bethlehem was--which they did)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">, 
    and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher at Jerusalem, and according to legend, 
    she found the TRUE CROSS on which Christ had been crucified. FOR THIS THE 
    CHURCH CANONIZED HER. </font><font size="3">(This was her most amazing accomplishment, 
    seeing how the True Cross was by then being carried throughout the earth by 
    all of the righteous in the earth)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Helena was the mother 
    of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, whose reign from 306-337 AD saw 
    the emergence of Christianity from a persecuted sect to the powerful State

    crucial battle (with his enemy, Maxentius) that Constantine saw above the

    Sol Invictus...see Isaiah 66:4)...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
    Constantine attributed his victory to the Christian God. From that time on 
    he praised the blessings that Christ had conferred on him and described himself 
    as belonging to the Christian Church. He legalized the church calendar and 
    designated SUNday as a holy day. Furthermore he appointed Christians in ever-increasing

<p><font size="+1">For the Hebrew scribes names did certainly travel. In fact 
  their use of the term &quot;Philistia&quot; was not simply used to describe 
  the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and the borders of Palestine as 
  we know them, but to describe the seacoasts of the entire Western mystery, from 
  the East as far as Eden in America. We understand it in the term <i>Whole Palestina</i> 
  (Isaiah 14:25-32), and in the words that say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Are ye not as children of the </font></i>(original)<i><font size="+1"> 
    Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have I not brought 
    up Israel out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and 
    the Syrians from Kir?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Amos 9:7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These names (as old as the Torah itself), all came back up 
  into the center of the Mystery with the children of Israel in the time of Joshua 
  (see Genesis 26:1 and 20:2), long before the Philistines as they are described 
  in the Books of Samuel even existed. (Please follow this line of thought in 
  the article entitled &quot;The Search For History in the Bible,&quot; in the 
  March/April 2000 edition of the <i>Biblical Archaeology Review</i>). And as 
  a result, the mystery of the Philistines, and the names and the places later 
  associated with them, actually took literary form in Europe and remained hidden 
  there in the books of the Hebrew prophets (some have associated Gaza with Cadiz 
  in Spain), until they spread themselves abroad again after the time of Christ--in 
  the Mystery of Christ. As the World-church established its various seats of 
  power throughout the Mediterranean world it carried with it, back out of Europe 
  as it were, the whole effect and intent of the prophetic word itself. They were 
  the Philistines. Understanding these things in this light we simply associate 
  Ashdod with Rome, and this because as the one rose to prominence in ancient 
  times so the other ascended to the same height of ecclesiastical power after 
  the time of Christ.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is very hard to resist associating this Great Stone of Abel 
  with Stone Mountain, Georgia. But in any case we discover that the Ark has returned 
  to the West, to Eden (the original Ethiopia), and to the place of the original 
  transgression, where the older son of Eve (Eve being the Church of those ancient 
  times) first slew the younger. (Genesis 4:1-15). (Open the Book of 1 John in 
  our own time).</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">But God smote the men of Beth-Shemesh, because they had

    so many people with</font></i><font size="+1"> <i>a great slaughter</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This means that neither the Catholic nor the great American 
  Protestant church which grew out of it were ever allowed to look into the mysteries 
  of God, because of their now mutual attachment to the ways of this world and 
  to the powers of this age. Besides all the judgment wars of Europe, the American 
  Civil War was, up to our own time, the most fitting description of this slaughter, 
  as it is also written: <i>For I will kindle a fire in thee...</i>(Ezekiel 20:42-49). 
  (It is also worthy to note the great desecration that has been committed upon 
  Stone Mountain, Georgia. There is an immense image engraved into it of three 
  very spiritually ill Confederate leaders, each of them deeply possessed of the 
  vainglorious ideals of military might--ideals which yielded to those individuals 
  and states who cherished them the demonic right to exercise and extend their 
  power over the lives of other human beings, all in complete violation of the 
  teachings and precepts of Christ. The Roman church was there, thick in the mix 
  of it all, in Richmond and Atlanta).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the men of Beth-she'mesh said, who is able to stand 
    before this holy Lord? and to whom shall he go up for us?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, 
    saying, The Philistines have brought again the Ark of the Lord, come ye down, 
    and fetch it up to you...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Samuel, chapter 6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This means that the Spirit finally committed the Ark to the 
  care of those who live in the &quot;forest,&quot; or &quot;the City of the Forest,&quot; 
  (1 Samuel 6:20 to 7:1), which means, to those who live deepest, or closest to 
  the Inner mystery of the Tree of Life. It was committed to them until DaViD 
  (the Messiahs) should bring it up in time to Jerusalem. (1 Chronicles 3; 2 Chron.1:4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">History knows of no Philistine presence anywhere in the world 
  at the time of the Patriarchs, yet the Hebrew scriptures mentions them in connection 
  with Abraham (Genesis 20), and in the story of Isaac and Abimelech (Genesis 
  26), further demonstrating how in the minds of the Hebrew scribes the Philistines 
  have always represented those worldly religious forces that always exist in 
  opposition to the precepts and doctrines of Light. Isaac himself, according 
  to the methods of these same Hebrew scribes, is a type and figure of the Christ-mystery 
  as Paul will later say: <i>If ye be Christ's then ye are Abraham's seed. </i>(Galatians 
  3:8-29). Paul would also have us realize that the entire Abraham-Sarah-Isaac-Ishmael-Hagar 
  episode (and therefore the Philistine episode), like the greater portion of 
  the Torah itself, is allegorical and archetypal, and must be read as such. These 
  are allegories not quite like any others in literature, however, for these have 
  literally reached right out of the literary realm to govern the religious, thus 
  the social and political realities of the world itself. (See Galatians 4:21-26). 
  In other words, the things that were written in the ancient Hebrew texts did 
  not &quot;happen&quot; as they were described, they are &quot;happening&quot; 
  as they were described:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in that same 
    year </font></i><font size="+1"><i>an Hundredfold and the Lord blessed him. 
    </i><font size="3">(See Matthew 13:8, 23...Thirtyfold is Hokhmah-Hesed-Netsah 
    on the Tree of Life; Sixtyfold is this plus Binah-Din-Hod--which implies an 
    understanding of both sides of the Tree of Life, whether it be Christian and 
    Jewish, or a male and female. One Hundredfold indicates an understanding of 
    the entire World-mystery from one end of the Tree of Life to the other)</font>.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And Isaac waxed great, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>AND 
    WENT FORWARD, AND GREW, until he became very great.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, 
    and a great store of servants: </font></i><font size="+1"><i>AND THE PHILISTINES 
    ENVIED HIM</i>.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For all the wells which his father's servants had digged 
    in the days of Abraham his father</font></i><font size="+1">, <i>THE PHILISTINES 
    HAD STOPPED THEM AND FILLED THEM WITH EARTH</i>. <font size="3">(With the 
    doctrines of men)</font>.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">AND ISAAC DIGGED AGAIN THE WELLS OF WATER, which they 
    had digged in the days of Abraham his father, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>AND 
    HE CALLED THEIR NAMES AFTER THE NAMES BY WHICH HIS FATHER HAD CALLED THEM</i>.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">AND ISAAC'S SERVANTS FOUND A WELL OF SPRINGING WATER. 
    </font></i><font size="3">(See John 4:10-14)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, 
    saying, The Water is our's; </font></i><font size="+1"><i>and he called the 
    name of the well</i> <i>(STRIFE)</i> <i>because they strove with him.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And they digged another well, and strove for that also;

    <i>and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful 
    in the land</i>.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he went up from thence TO BEER-SHE'BA</font></i><font size="+1">...(Genesis 
    26:12-23).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These verses tell of the Strife between Israel and the World-church, 
  which came in time to Accusation, and finally to the lines of conciliation that 
  were drawn between the two as God reopened the sea-lanes to the Western ends 
  of the earth. <i>Beer-She'ba</i> means &quot;the Seventh Well&quot; whose waters 
  flowed from the center of &quot;Many-Fountained Ida&quot;--the very center of 
  the Mystery itself. And though this well was virtually hidden from the mind 
  of the </font><font size="+1">World-church, the Roman emperors and Feudal lords, 
  and the now-modern states it supports, all of them were allowed to trample over 
  it anyway. (See Revelation 11:2). But because they had no idea where this well 
  was situated , it still flows, as it is written:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">In the last day, that day of the great feast, Jesus stood 
    and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</font></i></p>

<p><font size="+1">Learning how to read and interpret the oracles, we come to 
  realize that this great ecclesiastical heresy grew in large part out of its 
  inability to interpret the words: <i>And he hath made us kings and priests unto 
  God and his Father. </i>(Revelation 1:6; Ex.19:5,6). Without access to the Oracle, 
  and yet assuming the authority of interpretation to itself, the emerging World-church 
  took it to mean Emperors and Popes (or Czars and Patriarchs or Metropolitans), 
  and so began the oppression. But so are the words fulfilled which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall 
    speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words 
    thou shalt be condemned...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 12:36,37).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The great world-church must give account of such words as these:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...What sort of people do 
    you think they are, those enemies of the priests and rebels against the Catholic 
    Church, who are alarmed neither by the severe warning of the Lord, nor by 
    the vengeance of future judgments? For this has been the source from which 
    heresies and schisms have arisen, that God's priest is not obeyed, nor do 
    people reflect that there is for the time one priest in the Church, who for 
    the time is judge instead of Christ; and if the whole brotherhood would obey 
    him, according to divine teachings, no one would stir up anything against 
    the college of priests...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peter, however, on whom the Church

  enough to simply ask our Catholic, and otherwise Orthodox brothers and sisters

  disorders, tortures, persecutions, murders, pogroms, genocides, intrigues with 
  tyrant rulers, and holy wars that have been released upon humanity by the priests 
  of this church in the name of Christ. All these things, no matter what excuses

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most large organizations have a 
    procedure for repudiating the actions of a chief executive who as made autocratic 
    and disastrous decisions. In theory, the Roman Catholic Church does too: a 
    General Council has the right to change church doctrine or policy. But in 
    the last couple of centuries, papal bullying has reduced councils to impotence. 
    So Catholics who think as Gary Wills, that the papacy is disgracing the church 
    have no one to turn to except their fellow congregants.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wills, an eminent historian and 
    one of the most intellectually distinguished members of the Catholic laity 
    in the United States, has written a devastating, no-holds-barred, indictment.</font> 
    (May we add at the outset that Wills' contentions, as we shall see, tend to 
    suffer from an overly Catholic and American point of view themselves. Maybe 
    it is just an overly scholarly point of view. Maybe it's just his attachment 
    to Augustine)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. In Part I of <i>Papal 
    Sin</i>--Historical Dishonesties--he shows how the hierarchy has persistently 
    lied and weasled about what the church did and did not do during the Holocaust. 
    Part II--Doctrinal Dishonesties--argues that recent popes have turned Leninist: 
    they have cared more about retaining their grip on authority than about the 
    needs of those whom they claim to serve.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last two parts of the book--&quot;The 
    Honesty Issue&quot; and &quot;The Splendor of Truth&quot;--Wills writes about 
    his heroes: Lord Acton, Cardinal Newman and St. Augustine. He offers them 
    as examples to whom the church might turn in order to escape from the Orwellian 
    &quot;structures of deceit&quot; currently built into the papal office...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The pope alone, we are now 
    asked to accept, is competent to tell Christian people how to live...The Holy 
    Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the omnicompetent head of the 
    church, a church that is all head and no limbs. If that were so, then the 
    body of Christ would be shamefully reduced.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he has many other examples 
    of dishonesty: tortured interpretations of Scripture, blatant distortions 
    of ecclesiastical history, endless hypocritical whining and just plain lies. 
    He is startingly frank on issues that most Catholic writers avoid, as when 
    he writes, &quot;In fact, the admission of married men and women to the priesthood--which 
    is bound to come anyway--may well come for the wrong reason, not because women 
    and the community deserve this, but because of panic at the perception that 
    the priesthood is becoming predominantly gay.&quot; He is equally blunt about 
    the present pope, whom he describes in the same sort of terms Acton used of 
    Pius IX: &quot;The rest of the church must live in structures of deceit because 
    this one man is true to his intensely personal vision.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wills takes with utter seriousness 
    the text (John 14:6) that says that Christ is truth. He praises Augustine 
    as the theologian who best understood and explicated this claim, and as authority 
    for the view that &quot;the new papal sin, of deception, is worse than the 
    vivider old sins of material greed, proud ambition or sexual license. It is 
    spiritual sin, an interior baffling of the Spirit's access to the soul.&quot; 
    But Wills might have a harder time getting Augustine to go along when he says: 
    &quot;I do not think that my church has a monopoly on the Spirit, which breathes 
    where She will, in every Christian sect and denomination. In fact She breathes 
    through all religious life, wherever the divine call is heeded, among Jews 
    and Buddhist and Muslims and others.&quot; That is the language of Acton's 
    19th century, not of Augustine's 4th.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wills is a historian of American 
    freedom whose writings have breathed new life into the words of Jefferson 
    and Lincoln. Predictably he wants a free and democratic Catholic Church, one 
    which has no time for heresy hunting, and in which the popes live up to their 
    ancient title: &quot;servant of the servants of God.&quot; Yet Augustine spent 
    a lot of time detecting and denouncing heresies, and so must any institution 
    which is going to claim a special, privileged, hookup with the divine. If 
    God really is generous enough to acknowledge the Jews and the Buddhists as 
    heeding his call, then it is not clear why we need a church of Christ...The 
    church's traditional view has been that God is not that generous, and that 
    Christians must believe that Christ's apostles and their authorized successors--but 
    not those of Buddha or Joseph Smith or Muhammad--provide the necessary means 
    to salvation. For better or for worse, Augustine would have agreed. Wills 
    does not... </font>The New York Times Book Review, June 11, 2000<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">First of all, Augustine and John Paul II have much more in 
  common than they differ. Augustine (who feared, mistrusted, or despised, almost 
  all &quot;women,&quot; virtually cutting himself off from the mystery of Life 
  itself), also reasoned for himself, and therefore for the entire Catholic church, 
  that:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Divine providence is concerned 
    with salvation, not with history as such, therefore the intrinsic dualism 
    characterizing the historical process--the struggle between the heavenly and 
    the profane cities--would be resolved only beyond time and history...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History, devoid of all human progress, 
    was therefore regarded by Augustine as without meaning, and his attitude toward 
    history, and hence the world, was thus based on alienation from it, and not 
    upon reconciliation...Nor, believed Augustine, did sacred providential history 
    lend any significance to profane history. As R.A. Markus puts it:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Since the coming of Christ, until 
    the end of the world, all history is homogenous, it cannot be mapped out in 
    terms of a pattern drawn from sacred history, it can no longer contain decisive 
    turning points endowed with a significance in the ultimate tableau of man's 
    doings and sufferings; but it is a significance to which God's revelation 
    does not give a clue.'&quot; </font>Avihu Zakai, Hebrew University of Jerusalem<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Zakai describes Augustine's world-view as &quot;a permanent 
  pilgrimage upon earth--as resident strangers and aliens.&quot; With this we 
  agree, for our long-home is in the heavens beyond. But Augustine's, thus the 
  present Pope's world-view--firmly rooted in a clear inability to perceive or 
  interpret the signs of the times, or even in a desire to do so--would leave 
  those who are presently in charge of the world still in charge, with only the 
  Papacy's guiding religious principles, as it were, to assist them. The conditions 
  of our pilgrimage would remain the same--and for the great mass of humanity 
  they are the conditions of powerlessness, anonymous suffering, and absolute 
  despair...with no hope of &quot;salvation.&quot;...</font></p>

  personalities of the age still parading themselves before us, still blessing 
  us with their empty, high-sounding religious and political phrases, and their 
  unfulfilled dictates. God's plan is different. It is climactic and apocalyptic. 
  The apocalypse is unfolding as we read. Our lives will always be those of the 
  pilgrim, of self-preparation for Life in the eternal realm-beyond. But unlike 
  today our lives will become truly capable, transformed, and empowered to radiate 
  God's righteousness and justice (be wise now you fundamentalists), and God's 
  love into the world below. The next phase of human progress will come as the 
  true Nation-church is born-again out of the events of this age. The true Messiahs 
  will be manifest (an office that will subsequently, and throughout time, pass 
  to every family and race of man on the face of the earth), and the Law will 
  issue forth--not from Rome but from Zion. And Jerusalem will always represent 
  the Doorway--the Two Leaved Gate--to the Universe beyond...a Doorway that will 
  be opened to all who come:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The paradox, as we have mentioned before, exists in the fact 
  that the Father, the God of War (revealed in the sign of Aries--the Ram), will 
  not reveal Himself to any but children of perfect Peace. (Hebrews 12:14). These 
  children of Peace, however, are not those who merely pay lip-service to peace, 
  and then condone or resort to war in the extreme, as the World-church and the 
  nations do (see Isaiah, chapter 59), but they are those who wage war against 
  Israel's, and thus the Church's complicity in war itself, and this to the extreme. 
  Thus by the Pope's inability to instruct the Church in the ways of the Sovereign 
  Nature of God, or in the hidden dimensions of the oracles, he leaves his church 
  (after every magnificent and triumphant visit) in a state of total darkness, 
  and without a commandment or the ability to separate itself from the affairs 
  of these warring nations, thus from the unfolding judgments of God. The Pope's 
  encyclical, &quot;The Redeemer of Man,&quot; renders God &quot;unterrible,&quot; 
  thus &quot;unglorified,&quot; and God's Anointed Ones &quot;unheralded.&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Among the issues facing the world today, which the Law and 
    the Prophets, and the true Spirit of Christ have been given to address, is 
    nationalism--whether it be cultural or religious. It was this primal, social 
    instinct for self-identity, self-preservation, and self-emulation, that the 
    first Adam had to address. (And while it seemed to prove Adam's undoing--given 
    the history of the world since then--overcoming it was also the means by which 
    the inner teachings of Adam were carried throughout the earth). This spirit 
    of nationalism has grown now through all of its own natural stages to this 
    final phase: Supra-nationalism--a Supra-tribal state which the Supra-nationalists, 
    or Supra-Globalists in the world would hope to create in their own collective 
    image, against which the children of Light in the earth are still struggling. 
    Nationalism (in the name of the Lord) is a grievous violation against the 
    commandments of God</font><font size="+1">, against the final and full effect 
    of God's creative work among men, of which the prophets have not ceased to 
    remind us and warn us for over three thousand years. (Please consider the 
    sub chapter entitled <i>The Nations</i> in the Addendum to this work). Just 
    as flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, so neither can the various 
    other nations of men inherit God's ultimate blessings, Nature's fullest gifts. 
    Thus it is written of the Universal Israel, that it is a people redeemed <i>OUT 
    FROM AMONG THE NATIONS</i>. (Revelation 5:9). (Of course, those who have been 
    following the previous chapters of this work realize how inclusive the idea 
    of Universal Israel is, encompassing all religious tradition together; and 
    know that our sense of the Mystery of Christ is larger than Christianity itself):

    own life, such as a figure of the Buddha, or Francis, or a loved one. It does 
    not mean that one may not have inspirational symbols and sacred pictures on 
    one's wall. The children of Light walk circumspectly, and see every side to 
    God's commandments, and every manifestation of God's Presence in the earth, 
    and they understand the difference between accord and violation. It means 
    that if we do possess or encounter an image, it must be with a very high and 
    elevated, and focused, state of mind. Seeing how every sacred symbol points 
    to the same reality--to the same Oneness of the One God who created all, and 
    who permeates and dwells in all. And the One points to the Two, who together, 
    in both Principle and Form, rule the Universe. Their Throne extends from the 
    most distant galaxies to the soul of every tiniest creature on earth. Thus 
    to contemplate a Sacred Tree is to contemplate the mysteries of theUniverse. 
    To sit before an image of Buddha is to contemplate the principles that Buddha 
    taught. To kneel before a Crucifix is to draw closer to the mystery of the 
    Cross. To thank a flower for existing is to thank the Almighty. To embrace 
    a child is to embrace God. To kneel before Nature in reverence is to kneel 
    before the Creators themselves. Music, the arts, the architecture of our very

  of the Croatian <i>nationalist</i>, Cardinal Alojzije Stepanic, who, according 
  to many Serbs, was a Nazi sympathizer and a war criminal, John-Paul was photographed 
  at a huge outdoor Mass administering the sacraments to uniformed Croatian soldiers. 
  So where is the problem here? Isn't it a priest's duty to administer the sacraments? 
  (No, it is the priest's duty to become the sacrament).The problem is that he 
  fed these poor soldiers pieces of Catholic bread, and nothing more, because 
  at the end of the Mass he left them in the very same condition as he found them--in 
  servitude to their religious, political, and military leaders, and still in 
  mortal danger of both their lives and their souls. Communion with the Mystery 
  of Christ should affect in the life of the communicant both a real change of 
  heart, and a real change in direction. He should have counseled these soldiers 
  to defect from their military duties, and to seek refuge in the Word of God. 
  He should have told them that they cannot be soldiers for Christ and soldiers 
  of the Croatian army at the same time, that they should choose, and choose right, 
  as it is written: <i>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; the Day 
  of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. </i>(Joel 3:14). He should have 
  told them that the sacrifice (of their own precious lives), the very same that 
  the nation is asking them to make, is a sacrifice unto devils and not to God.

<p><font size="+1">As the wave of historical events swept across the Western world, 
  from the first centuries of this present age to our own, we see that a form 
  of power did indeed bequeath itself to the institutions of the Roman church. 
  And for all cosmic purposes this power has indeed been passed on to it by the 
  God of History. But with every literary resource at our disposal, and with all 
  the events of history so glaringly evident to us, and with all the contrasts 
  between the teachings of Christ and the actual deeds of the church so plain 
  to us, we can now also plainly see what kind of power the hierarchy of this 
  church inherited (rooted as it is, not in the <i>mysterium </i>of Christ but 
  in the <i>magesterium</i>). It is a form of power almost wholly political and 
  bureaucratic in nature, which has always relied on outward appearances, in rituals 
  and ecclesiastical trappings, but not in those qualities of the Spirit, or on 
  that cyclical sense of history, necessary to the attainment of prophetic insight 
  and vision. (The established church has produced many mystics but no prophets--none 
  that could continue in its fold that is). Thus the power God granted to it is 
  temporal, and clearly confined everywhere across the globe to the affairs of 
  this present age--an age that is in its own death throes, and which is about 
  to be brought to its own historic conclusion.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">These are the secret saying which the living Jesus </font></i>(He 
    in them, and they in He)<i><font size="+1"> spoke and which Diymos Judas Thomas

    sayings will not experience death.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Jesus said, Let them who seek continue seeking until they

<p><font size="+1">The power that the World-church was given, and which it in 
  turn enforces and transmits, is not the liberating power that Christ speaks 
  of (Galatians 5:1; John 8:31-36), which gives to those who exercise it power 
  over themselves and their own natural ways (liberating them in the process from 
  both themselves and the church's worldly and unskillful interpretation of the 
  sacred Word). But it was the opposite kind, a kind that emanates from below, 
  which seeks instead to exercise itself over the lives of others. The Irish singer, 
  Sinead O'Conner, payed a price for trying in her own tortured way to express 
  this disdain for the Roman hierarchy, for the ill effects of its dictates on 
  the lives of so many of its subjects. Others over the centuries have payed more 
  dearly. It is the kind of power that once it is invested cannot correct itself, 
  and was therefore fated to appear at the end of the age in direct and unwitting 
  violation of the words which say:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Willing<i> </i>or not , ready 
    or not, we are involved in an all-out, no-holds-barred, three-way global competition. 
    Most of us are not competitors, however. We are the stakes. For the competition 
    is about who will establish the first one-world system of government that 
    has ever existed in the society of nations. It is about who will hold and 
    wield the dual power of authority and control over each of us as individuals 
    and over all of us together as a community...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No holds are barred because, once 
    the competition has been decided, the world and all that's in it--our way 
    of life as individuals and as citizens of the nations; our families and our 
    jobs; our trade and commerce and money; our educational systems and our religions 
    and our cultures; even the badges of our national identity, which most of 
    us have always taken for granted--all will have been powerfully and radically 
    altered forever. No one can be exempted from its effects. No sector of our 
    lives will remain untouched...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The competition began and continues 
    as a three-way affair because that is the number of rivals with sufficient 
    resources to establish and maintain a new world order. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobody who is acquainted with the 
    plans of these three rivals has any doubt but that only one of them can win. 
    Each expects the other two to be overwhelmed and swallowed up in the coming 
    maelstrom of change. That being the case, it would appear inescapable that 
    their competition will end up as a confrontation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to the time factor involved, 
    those of us who are under seventy will see at least the basic structure of 
    the new world government installed. Those of us under forty will surely live 
    under its legislative, executive and judiciary authority and control. Indeed, 
    the three rivals themselves...speak about this new world order not as something 
    around the distant corner of time, but as something that is imminent. As a 
    system that will be introduced and installed in our midst by the end of this 
    final decade of the second millennium.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What these competitors are talking 
    about, then, is the most profound and widespread modification of international, 
    national, and local life that the world has seen in a thousand years. And 
    the competition they are engaged in can be described simply enough as THE 
    MILLENNIUM END GAME...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not too much to say, in fact, 
    that the chosen purpose of John Paul's pontificate--the engine that drives 
    his papal grand policy and that determines his day-to-day, year-by-year strategies--is 
    to be the victor in that competition, now well under way. For the fact is 
    that the stakes John Paul has placed in the arena of geopolitical contention 
    include everything--himself; his papal persona; the age-old Petrine Office 
    he now embodies; and his entire Church Universal, both as an institutional 
    organization unparalleled in the world and as a body of believers united by 
    a bond of mystical communion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other two contenders in the 
    arena of THIS&quot;GREATEST HISTORICAL CONFRONTATION HUMANITY HAS GONE THROUGH&quot; 
    are no mean adversaries. Rather, they are the leaders of the two most deeply 
    entrenched secular powers, who stand, in a collective sense, on their record 
    as the authors and the primary actors in the period of history that has been 
    so much the worst of times that the best face we can put on it is to say that 
    we were not swallowed up in the Apocalypse of World War III--as if that were 
    the best man could do for his fellowman.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first of those two powers, 
    the Soviet Union, is now led by John Paul's most interesting adversary and 
    a fellow Slav. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev was as unexpected and unpredicted 
    a leader in the new world arena as Karol Wojtoyla himself...Gorbachev is now 
    what he was groomed to be: Master of the Leninist-Marxist Party-State whose 
    power and standing in the community of nations was built upon seventy years 
    of physical and spiritual fratricide carried out in the name of a purely sociopolitical 
    vision and a thoroughly this-worldly ideology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final contender in the competition 
    for the new world order is not a single individual leader of a single institution 
    or territory. IT IS A GROUP OF MEN WHO ARE UNITED AS ONE IN POWER, MIND, AND 
    WILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING A SINGLE COMMON GOAL: TO BE VICTORIOUS IN 
    THE COMPETITION FOR THE NEW GLOBAL HEGEMONY.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the acknowledged public leader 
    and spokesman for this group is the current American president, the contenders 
    who compose this assemblage of individuals are Americans and Europeans who, 
    taken together, represent every nation of the Western democratic alliance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unremittingly globalist in their 
    vision and activities, these individual operate from two principle bases of 
    power. The first is the power base of finance, industry, and technology. Entrepreneurial 
    in their occupations, the men in this phalanx qualify themselves, and are 
    often referred to by others, as &quot;Transnationalist&quot; in their outlook. 
    What they mean by the term &quot;Transnationalist&quot; is that they intend 
    to, and increasingly do, exercise their entrepreneurship on a worldwide basis. 
    Leaping over all the barriers of language, race, ideology, creed, color, and 
    nationalism, they view the world with some justification as their oyster; 
    and the twin pearls of great price that they seek are global development and 
    the good life for all.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of the second phalanx of 
    this group of global contenders--Internationalists, as they are frequently 
    called--bring with them invaluable experience in government, in intergovernmental 
    relationships, and in the rarefied art of international politics. Their bent 
    is toward the development of new and ever wider interrelationships between 
    the governments of the world. Their aim is to foster increasing cooperation 
    on an international basis--and to do that by maintaining the peace, at the 
    same time they accomplish what war has rarely achieved: the breakdown of the 
    old natural and artificial barriers between nations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the current competition to establish 
    and head a one-world government, Transnationalists and Internationalists can 
    be said for all practical purposes to act as one; to constitute one main contender: 
    The Genuine Globalists of the West. Both groups are products par excellence 
    of the system of democratic capitalism. Both are so closely intertwined in 
    their membership that individuals move easily and with great effect from an 
    Internationalist to a Transnationalist role and back again. And not least 
    important in the all-encompassing confrontation that is underway, both groups 
    share the same philosophy about human life and its ultimate meaning--a philosophy 
    that appears, in the surprised view of some observers, to be closer to Mikhail 
    Gorbachev's than to John Paul's...Beneath the similarity of language, however, 
    their lies a vast difference in meaning and intent; and greatly dissimilar 
    track records of accomplishment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The individual in Gorbachev's new 
    world order will be someone whose needs and rights are determined by the monopolar 
    government of Leninist-Marxism. Indeed, all individual rights and freedom 
    and dignity are to be measured by the needs of the Party to remain supreme 
    and permanent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the new world order of the Wise 
    Men of the West--the most powerful of the Genuine Globalists--the rights and 
    freedom of the individual would be based in positive law: that is, on laws 
    passed by the majority of those who will be entitled to vote on the various 
    levels of the new system of governmental administration and local organization. 
    ULTIMATE RULE, HOWEVER, WILL BE FAR REMOVED FROM THE ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prime difficulty for Pope John 
    Paul II in both of these models for the new world order is that neither of 
    them is rooted in the moral laws of human behavior revealed by God through 
    the teachings of Christ, as proposed by Christ's Church. He is adamant on 
    one capital point: No system will ensure and guarantee the rights and freedoms 
    of the individual if it is not based on those laws.This is the backbone principle 
    of the new world envisaged by the Pontiff...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There exists on this earth,&quot; 
    (said the Pontiff's mentor, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski), &quot;only three 'Internationales.'&quot; 
    The &quot;Golden Internationale&quot; was his shorthand term for the financial 
    powers of the world--the Transnationalist and Internationalist globalist leaders 
    of the West.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Red Internationale&quot;

    It is a Slavic Pope. The imbalance in our thinking has been unobtrusively 
    but decisively and, as it were, overnight corrected by the emergence of John 
    Paul. For his persona has refocused international attention away from the 
    two extremes, East and West, and on THE ACTUAL CENTER OF CHANGE, 'MITTELEUROPA,' 
    the central bloc of Europe's nations.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presciently as well as by planned 
    design, the Pontiff's first step into the geopolitical arena was eastward 
    into Poland, the underbelly of the Soviet Union. In John Paul's geopolitical

    power. THE HOLY FATHER'S BATTLE WAS TO CONTROL THAT CENTER...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">And please notice how the Holy Spirit was referred to with 
  the words &quot;His Coming.&quot; This Catholic attitude toward the Feminine 
  Principle, and the Feminine Presence of the Godhead is very cleverly characterized 
  in one of the scenes in the stage production Riverdance, where three male figures 
  dressed in black, representing the Roman Catholic doctrine of an all-male Trinity, 
  appear on stage in an attempt to separate the people from their real devotion, 
  and their distant memories of the truly Divine Mother. She--The Holy Spirit 
  of God--is, of course, Feminine. She is Mother, sometimes virgin, often times

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is why sex is holy. 
    The desire of union is the reflection in us of the love of the Holy Trinity. 
    May we not say that the Holy Spirit is feminine? It is the eternal Wisdom, 
    which in Hebrew, Greek and Latin is always feminine, the divine Sophia. The 
    Holy Spirit is immanent in all creation. It is the love which draws the Father 
    to create, to conceive the whole creation in his Son. In Hindu tradition the 
    world came into being as a result of the union of Siva and Sakti, the divine 
    consciousness uniting with the divine power. This is why the lingham and the 
    yoni are sacred in India. They are symbols of Siva and Sakti, of Purusha and 
    Prakriti; every human marriage reflects this divine marriage, is a symbol 
    of the marriage of heaven and earth....&quot; </font>Father Bede Griffith,

<p><font size="+1">The error, which Bede Griffith is attempting to address, is 
  born in the common association interpreters have made over the centuries between 
  the figure of the <i>Comforter</i> in the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit of 
  God Herself. We do not want to confuse ourselves by getting into the business 
  of splitting complex terms but it seems necessary to do so here. The term <i>comforter</i> 
  derives from the Spirit's instructions to the prophet at Isaiah, chapter 40 
  (KJV), and defines the relationship that exists between the Angel of Divine 
  Presence who hovers above the dimensions of the Tree of Life, and those (the 
  saints and prophets), who actually appear in the name of the Lord to comfort 
  the people themselves. Some of those who have appeared to comfort the people 
  have been male, such as the spirit of Elijah that appeared in the person of 
  John the Baptist, but many of these comforters over the centuries have also 
  been female. Islam holds that the Comforter, or a figure of the Comforter, appeared 
  in the person of the prophet Muhammad. All of them, nevertheless, have appeared 
  in the Mystery of Christ at the direction of the Holy Spirit Herself, the Divine 
  Feminine Principle, who, with God and as God, dwells above all things and in 
  all things. (John 14:16, 26; Jn.15:26; Jn.16:7-10). So do not, as so many others, 
  confuse the Comforter with the Holy Spirit of God who is our Divine Mother Herself...</font></p>

      and in every cosmic sense is Them. If we can see the one we can see the

    Day of Prayer for Vocations. Heeding the words of Jesus in the Gospel to &quot;beg 
    the Harvest Master to send laborers,&quot; the Holy Father asks us all to 
    pray for vocations in the church. We are encouraged most especially to pray 
    that young men and women might explore the possibility of vocations to the

    and the encouragement he received from priests and religious as important

    a great blessing that SEVEN Men will begin priestly ministry in our parishes 
    this summer, it is a sure sign that the Lord continues to call our young people 
    to vocations in the Church. THESE SEVEN MEN NEED OUR PRAYERS...May we be very

    view the use of force as a matter of legality, as a matter of morality and 
    as a matter of protecting the American people.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Fleischer added that Bush respects the opinions of those who disagree 
    with him and said the president is eager to &quot;find out what the message 
    of the Pope is on this topic.&quot; Bush is to meet Wednesday with Cardinal 
    Pio Laghi, a former papal nuncio to the United States, who said he will come 
    bearing the pope's warning on war. </b></p>
  <p><b>The meeting and Laghi's message pose a tough political problem for Bush, 
    who has aggressively courted Roman Catholic voters after splitting the Catholic 
    vote in 2000 with Democrat Al Gore . Catholics made up a quarter of the 2000 
    electorate.</b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The pope also used his remarks 
    to to revisit the night of his election and the awe that he felt. &quot;How 
    could I, humanly speaking, not tremble?&quot; he said. &quot;HOW COULD SUCH 
    A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY NOT WEIGH ON ME?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Paul has won the hearts of 
    many Catholics and alienated many others. HE WAS BOUNDLESSLY ENERGETIC AND 
    VISIONARY IN HIS TRAVELS but staunchly traditional in his interpretation of 
    many church teachings. HE RELISHED THE SPOTLIGHT AND FLOURISHED IN IT, at 
    least until recently. The pope is now stooped and almost completely immobile, 
    and he was transported into St. Peter's Square in a wheelchair. His physical 
    deterioration lent an elegiac air to the event. BUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THE 
    POPE CONTINUED TO PONDER THE FUTURE, BOTH HIS OWN AND THE CHURCH'S.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the ceremony, he released 
    a 196-page document that offers instruction to Catholic bishops and draws 
    attention to what he casts as an increasingly troubling gulf between developed 
    nations and the developing world, the rich and poor. He frames that divide 
    AS A CHALLENGE THAT CATHOLICS MUST CONFRONT...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This pope has done so much 
    for peace and dialogue, but also for the unity of the church,&quot; said Cardinal 
    Claudio Hummes, the archbishop of Sao Paulo, Brazil. On that last point, many 
    Catholics would disagree. John Paul repeatedly dashed the hopes of progressives 
    who urged the ordination of women as priests and an end to the vow of celibacy 
    for priests. He stood firm in opposition to artificial birth control and civil 
    recognition for same-sex couples. But the focus on Thursday was on the pope's 
    achievements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although he seems at long last 
    to be slowing down, he vowed to press on, saying in his sermon that God, &quot;while 
    knowing my human frailty, encourages me to respond with faith...He invites 
    me to assume the responsibilities that he himself has entrusted to me,&quot; 
    the pope added. </font>The New York Times<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Despite the fact that God--Heaven and Earth--the Divine Father 
  and Mother Themselves--is not celibate (They are sexually, romantically, tantrically 
  and cosmically in love with each other, and all of Life itself is the fruit 
  of their union), and despite the fact that both John and Paul themselves have 
  already been united with their own spiritual soul mates--the eternal love of 
  their lives--the headlines still read:</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a stern message just days before 
    he meets with U.S. cardinals to discuss the clergy sex-abuse scandal, Pope 
    John Paul II yesterday said priests must keep celibate and avoid scandalous 
    behavior...&quot;The value of celibacy as a complete gift of self to the Lord 
    and his church must be carefully safeguarded&quot; the pope told the bishops 
    in his most extensive remarks about the issue since the scandal in America 
    erupted...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The summit will be in one of the 
    more ornate wings of the Vatican, but the historic conclave will be filled 
    with anything but pageantry. There will be a few stately moments--and certainly 
    a few prayers--but after that it's straight to work, Vatican insiders said. 
    &quot;It's not going to a ceremonial thing where the pope reads a speech, 
    and they kiss his ring and leave,&quot; said John Allen, author of &quot;Conclave: 
    The Politics, Personalities and Process of the Next Papal Election.&quot;...</font></p>
